Hartree-Fock or Kohn- Sham Hamiltonians (that adopt an Exchange-Correlation potential following the postulates of Density-Functional Theory) can be used. Systems periodic in 0 (molecules, 0D), 1 (polymers, 1D), 2 (slabs, 2D), and 3 dimensions (crystals, 3D) are treated on an equal footing. In each case the fundamental approximation made is the expansion of the single particle wave functions (’Crystalline Orbital’, CO) as a linear combination of Bloch functions (BF) deﬁned in terms of local functions (hereafter indicated as ’Atomic Orbitals’, AOs). See Chapter 18. The local functions are, in turn, linear combinations of Gaussian type functions (GTF) whose exponents and coeﬃcients are deﬁned by input (section 2.2). Functions of symmetry s, p, d, f, g can be used (see page 27). Also available are sp shells (s and p shells, sharing the same set of exponents). The use of sp shells can give rise to considerable savings in CPU time. The program can automatically handle space symmetry: 230 space groups, 80 layer groups, 99 rod groups, 45 point groups are available (Appendix A). In the case of polymers it can treat helical structures (translation followed by a rotation around the periodic axis). Point symmetries compatible with translation symmetry are provided for molecules. Input tools allow the generation of slabs (2D system), nano-rods (1D system) or clusters (0D system) from a 3D crystalline structure, the elastic distortion of the lattice, the creation of a super-cell with a defect and a large variety of structure editing. See Section 3.1 Speciﬁc input options allow generation of special 1D (single and multi-wall nanotubes) and 0D (fullerenes) structures from 2D ones. Previous releases of the software in 1988 (CRYSTAL88, [77]), 1992 (CRYSTAL92, [80]), 1996 (CRYSTAL95, [81]), 1998 (CRYSTAL98, [247]), 2003 (CRYSTAL03, [248]), 2006 (CRYS- TAL06, [82]), 2010 (CRYSTAL09, [75]), 2013 (CRYSTAL14, [76]) and 2017 (CRYSTAL17, [83]) have been used in a wide variety of research applications.

The geometry of a system is deﬁned by the crystal structure ([118], Chapter 1 of ref. [220]). Reference is made to the International Tables for Crystallography [133] for all deﬁnitions. The crystal structure is determined by the space group, by the shape and size of the unit cell and by the relative positions of the atoms in the asymmetric unit. 3. The lattice parameters represent the length of the edges of the cell (a,b,c) and the angles between the edges (α = c b c; β = c a c; γ = c a b). They determine the cell volume and shape. 4. Minimal set of lattice parameters to be deﬁned in input: cubic a hexagonal a,c trigonal hexagonal cell a,c rhombohedral cell a, α tetragonal a,c orthorhombic a,b,c monoclinic a,b,c, β (b unique) a,b,c, γ (c unique) a,b,c, α (a unique - non standard) triclinic a,b,c, α, β, γ 5. The asymmetric unit is the largest subset of atoms contained in the unit-cell, where no atom pair related by a symmetry operator can be found. Usually several equivalent subsets of this kind may be chosen so that the asymmetric unit needs not be unique. The asymmetric unit of a space group is a part of space from which, by application of all symmetry operations of the space group, the whole of space is ﬁlled exactly. 22'},\n"," {'page_number': 22,\n","  'page_char_count': 3337,\n","  'page_word_count': 532,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 31,\n","  'page_token_count': 834.25,\n","  'text': '6. The crystallographic, or conventional cell, is used as the standard option in input. It may be non-primitive, which means it may not coincide with the cell of minimum volume (primitive cell), which contains just one lattice point. The matrices which transform the conventional (as given in input) to the primitive cell (used by CRYSTAL) are given in Appendix A.5, page 426, and are taken from Table 5.1 of the International Tables for Crystallography [133]. Examples. A cell belonging to the face-centred cubic Bravais lattice has a volume four times larger than that of the corresponding primitive cell, and contains four lattice points (see page 75, keyword SUPERCEL). A unit cell belonging to the hexagonal Bravais lattice has a volume three times larger than that of the rhombohedral primitive cell (R Bravais lattice), and contains three lattice points. 7. The use of the International Tables to identify the symmetry groups requires some prac- tice. The examples given below may serve as a guide. The printout of geometry informa- tion (equivalent atoms, fractional and Cartesian atomic coordinates etc.) allows a check on the correctness of the group selected. To obtain a complete neighborhood analysis for all the non-equivalent atoms, a complete input deck must be read in (blocks 1-3), and the keyword TESTPDIM inserted in block 3, to stop execution after the symmetry analysis. 8. Diﬀerent settings of the origin may correspond to a diﬀerent number of symmetry oper- ators with translational components. Example: bulk silicon - Space group 227 - 1 irreducible atom per cell. setting of the origin Si coordinates symmops with multiplicity translational component 2nd (default) 1/8 1/8 1/8 36 2 1st 0. 0. 0. 24 2 NB With diﬀerent settings, the same position can have diﬀerent multiplicity. For instance, in space group 227 (diamond, silicon) the position (0., 0., 0.) has multiplicity 2 in 1st setting, and multiplicity 4 in 2nd setting. Second setting is the default choice in CRYSTAL. The choice is important when generating a supercell, as the ﬁrst step is the removal of the symmops with translational component. The keyword ORIGIN (input block 1, page 64) translates the origin in order to minimize the number of symmops with translational component. 9. When coordinates are obtained from experimental data or from geometry optimization with semi-classical methods, atoms in special positions, or related by symmetry are not correctly identiﬁed, as the number of signiﬁcative digits is lower that the one used by the program crystal to recognize equivalence or special positions. In that case the coordinates must be edited by hand (see FAQ at www.crystal.unito.it). 10. The symbol of the space group for crystals (IFLAG=1) is given precisely as it appears in the International Tables, with the ﬁrst letter in column one and a blank separating operators referring to diﬀerent symmetry directions. The symbols to be used for the groups 221-230 correspond to the convention adopted in editions of the International Tables prior to 1983: the 3 axis is used instead of 3. See Appendix A.1, page 418. Examples: Group number input symbol 137 (tetragonal) P␣42/N␣M␣C 10 (monoclinic) P␣1␣2/M␣1 (unique axis b, standard setting) P␣1␣1␣2/M (unique axis c) P␣2/M␣1␣1 (unique axis a) 25 (orthorhombic) P␣M␣M␣2 (standard setting) 23'},\n"," {'page_number': 23,\n","  'page_char_count': 3214,\n","  'page_word_count': 544,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 36,\n","  'page_token_count': 803.5,\n","  'text': 'P␣2␣M␣M P␣M␣2␣M 11. In the monoclinic and orthorhombic cases, if the group is identiﬁed by its number (3-74), the conventional setting for the unique axis is adopted. The explicit symbol must be used in order to deﬁne an alternative setting. 12. For the centred lattices (F, I, C, A, B and R) the input cell parameters refer to the centred conventional cell; the fractional coordinates of the input list of atoms are in a vector basis relative to the centred conventional cell. 13. Rhombohedral space groups are a subset of trigonal ones. The Hermann-Mauguin symbol must begin by ’R’. For instance, space groups 156-159 are trigonal, but not rhombohedral (their Hermann-Mauguin symbols begin by ”P”). Rhombohedral space groups (146-148- 155-160-161-166-167) may have an hexagonal cell (a=b; c; α, β = 900; γ = 1200: input parameters a,c) or a rhombohedral cell (a=b=c; α = β = γ: input parameters = a, α). See input datum IFHR. 14. It is suﬃcient to supply the coordinates of only one of a group of atoms equivalent under centring translations (eg: for space group Fm3m only the parameters of the face-centred cubic cell, and the coordinates of one of the four atoms at (0,0,0), (0, 1 2, 1 2), ( 1 2,0, 1 2) and ( 1 2, 1 2,0) are required). The coordinates of only one atom among the set of atoms linked by centring translations are printed. The vector basis is relative to the centred conventional cell. However when Cartesian components of the direct lattice vectors are printed, they are those of the primitive cell. 15. The conventional atomic number NAT is used to associate a given basis set with an atom (see Basis Set input, Section 2.2, page 25). The real atomic number is given by the remainder of the division of the conventional atomic number by 100 (Example: NAT=237, Z=37; NAT=128, Z=28). Atoms with the same atomic number, but in non-equivalent positions, can be associated with diﬀerent basis sets, by using diﬀerent conventional atomic numbers: e.g. 6, 106, 1006 (all electron basis set for carbon atom); 206, 306 (core pseudo-potential for carbon atom, Section 3.2, page 84). If the remainder of the division is 0, a ”ghost” atom is identiﬁed, to which no nuclear charge corresponds (it may have electronic charge). This option may be used for enriching the basis set by adding bond basis function [10], or to allow build up of charge density on a vacancy. A given atom may be transformed into a ghost after the basis set deﬁnition (input block 2, keyword GHOSTS, page 82). 16. The keyword SLABCUT (Geometry editing input, page 71) allows the creation of a slab (2D) of given thickness from the 3D perfect lattice. See for comparison test4-test24; test5-test25; test6-test26; test7- test27. 17. For slabs (2D), when two settings of the origin are indicated in the International Tables for Crystallography, setting number 2 is chosen. The setting can not be modiﬁed. 18. Conventional orientation of slabs and polymers: Polymers are oriented along the x axis. Slabs are parallel to the xy plane. 19. The keywords MOLECULE (for molecular crystals only; page 56) and CLUSTER (for any n-D structure; page 45) allow the creation of a non-periodic system (molecule(s) or cluster) from a periodic one. 24'},\n"," {'page_number': 24,\n","  'page_char_count': 1977,\n","  'page_word_count': 353,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 5,\n","  'page_token_count': 494.25,\n","  'text': '2.2 Basis set Two diﬀerent methods are available to input basis set data: • Standard route • Basis set input by keywords 2.2.1 Standard route rec variable value meaning • ∗NAT n conventional atomic 3 number <200> 1000 all-electron basis set (Carbon, all electron BS: 6, 106, 1006) >200 valence electron basis set (Carbon, ECP BS: 206, 306) .

When an eﬀective core pseudo-potential is used, the basis set must be optimized with reference to that potential (Section 3.2, page 84). 1. A basis set (BS) must be given for each atom with diﬀerent conventional atomic number deﬁned in the crystal structure input. If atoms are removed (geometry input, keyword ATOMREMO, page 42), the corresponding basis set input can remain in the input stream. The keyword GHOSTS (page 82) removes the atom, leaving the associated basis set. 2. The basis set for each atom has NSHL shells, whose constituent AO basis functions are built from a linear combination (’contraction’) of individually normalized primitive Gaussian-type functions (GTF) (Chapter 18, page 400). 3. A conventional atomic number NAT links the basis set with the atoms deﬁned in the crystal structure. The atomic number Z is given by the remainder of the division of the conventional atomic number by 100 (Example: NAT=108, Z=8, all electron; NAT=228, Z=28, ECP). See point 5 below. 4. A conventional atomic number 0 deﬁnes ghost atoms, that is points in space with an associated basis set, but lacking a nuclear charge (vacancy). See test 28. 5. Atoms with equal conventional atomic number are associated with the same basis set. NAT < 200>1000: all electron basis set. A maximum of two diﬀerent basis sets may be given for the same chemical species in diﬀerent positions: NAT=Z, NAT=Z+100, NAT=Z+1000. NAT > 200: valence electron basis set. A maximum of two diﬀerent BS may be given for the same chemical species in positions not symmetry-related: NAT=Z+200, NAT=Z+300. A core pseudo-potential must be deﬁned. See Section 3.2, page 84, for information on core pseudo-potentials. Suppose we have four non-equivalent carbon atoms in the unit cell. Conventional atomic numbers 6 106 1006 206 306 mean that carbon atoms (real atomic number 6) unrelated by symmetry are to be associated with diﬀerent basis sets: the ﬁrst tree (6, 106, 1006) all-electron, the second two (206, 306) valence only, with pseudo-potential. 6. The basis set input ends with the card: 99 0 conventional atomic number 99, 0 shell. Optional keywords may follow. In summary: 1. CRYSTAL can use the following all electrons basis sets: a) general basis sets, including s, p, d, f, g functions (given in input); b) standard Pople basis sets [144] (internally stored as in Gaussian 94 [112]). STOnG, Z=1 to 54 6-21G, Z=1 to 18 3-21G, Z=1 to 54 The standard basis sets b) are stored as internal data in the CRYSTAL code. They are all electron basis sets, and can not be combined with ECP. 2. Warning The standard scale factor is used for STO-nG basis set when the input datum SCAL is 0.0 in basis set input.

They cannot be occupied in the guess. When symmetry adaptation of Bloch functions is active (default; NOSYMADA in block3 to remove it), if F (and G) functions are used, all lower order functions must be present (F, D, P, S). The order of internal storage of the AO basis functions is an information necessary to read certain quantities calculated by the program properties. See Chapter 14: Mul- liken population analysis (PPAN, page 122), electrostatic multipoles (POLI, page 350), projected density of states (DOSS,page 320) and to provide an input for some options (EIGSHIFT, input block 3, page 104). 5.

The atomic energy expression is not correct for all possible double open shell couplings of the form pmdn, pmf l, or dnf l. Either m must equal 3 or n must equal 5, or l must equal 7 for a correct energy expression in such cases. A warning will be printed if this is the case. However, the resultant wave function (which is a superposition of atomic densities) will usually provide a reasonable starting point for the periodic density matrix. 27'},\n"," {'page_number': 27,\n","  'page_char_count': 3382,\n","  'page_word_count': 566,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 28,\n","  'page_token_count': 845.5,\n","  'text': '10. When extended basis sets are used, all the functions corresponding to symmetries (an- gular quantum numbers) occupied in the isolated atom are added to the atomic basis set for atomic wave function calculations, even if the formal charge attributed to that shell is zero. Polarization functions are not included in the atomic basis set; their input occupation number should be zero. 11. The formal shell charges are used only to deﬁne the electronic conﬁguration of the atoms to compute the atomic wave function. The initial density matrix in the SCF step may be a superposition of atomic (or ionic) density matrices (default option, GUESSPAT, page 115). When a diﬀerent guess is required ( GUESSP), the shell charges are not used, but checked for electron neutrality when the basis set is entered. 12. Each atom in the cell may have an ionic conﬁguration, when the sum of formal shell charges (CHE) is diﬀerent from the nuclear charge. When the number of electrons in the cell, that is the sum of the shell charges CHE of all the atoms, is diﬀerent from the sum of nuclear charges, the reference cell is non-neutral. This is not allowed for periodic systems, and in that case the program stops. In order to remove this constraint, it is necessary to introduce a uniform charged background of opposite sign to neutralize the system [74]. This is obtained by entering the keyword CHARGED (page 80) after the standard basis set input. The value of total energy must be carefully checked. 13. It may be useful to allow atoms with the same basis set to have diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations (e.g, for an oxygen vacancy in MgO one could use the same basis set for all the oxygens, but begin with diﬀerent electronic conﬁguration for those around the vacancy). The formal shell charges attributed in the basis set input may be modiﬁed for selected atoms by inserting the keyword CHEMOD (input block 2, page 80). 14. The energies given by an atomic wave function calculation with a crystalline basis set should not be used as a reference to calculate the formation energies of crystals. The external shells should ﬁrst be re-optimized in the isolated atom by adding a low-exponent Gaussian function, in order to provide and adequate description of the tails of the isolated atom charge density [48] (keyword ATOMHF, input block 3, page 98).

The Hamiltonian matrix computed in direct space, Hg, is Fourier transformed for each k value, and diagonalized, to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Hk = X g Hgeigk HkAk = SkAkEk A second shrinking factor, ISP, deﬁnes the sampling of k points, ”Gilat net” [120, 119], used for the calculation of the density matrix and the determination of Fermi energy in the case of conductors (bands not fully occupied). The two shrinking factors are entered after the keyword SHRINK (page 124). In 3D crystals, the sampling points belong to a lattice (called the Pack-Monkhorst net), with basis vectors: b1/is1, b2/is2, b3/is3 is1=is2=is3=IS, unless otherwise stated where b1, b2, b3 are the reciprocal lattice vectors, and is1, is2, is3 are integers ”shrinking factors”. In 2D crystals, IS3 is set equal to 1; in 1D crystals both IS2 and IS3 are set equal to 1. Only points ki of the Pack-Monkhorst net belonging to the irreducible part of the Brillouin Zone (IBZ) are considered, with associated a geometrical weight, wi. The choice of the recip- rocal space integration parameters to compute the Fermi energy is a delicate step for metals. See Section 18.7, page 406. Two parameters control the accuracy of reciprocal space integration for Fermi energy calcula- tion and density matrix reconstruction: IS shrinking factor of reciprocal lattice vectors. The value of IS determines the number of k points at which the Fock/KS matrix is diagonalized. In high symmetry systems, it is convenient to assign IS magic values such that all low multiplicity (high symmetry) points belong to the Monkhorst lattice. Although this choice does not correspond to maximum eﬃciency, it gives a safer estimate of the integral. The k-points net is automatically made anisotropic for 1D and 2D systems. 32'},\n"," {'page_number': 32,\n","  'page_char_count': 1922,\n","  'page_word_count': 332,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 16,\n","  'page_token_count': 480.5,\n","  'text': 'The ﬁgure presents the reciprocal lattice cell of 2D graphite (rhombus), the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (hexagon), the irreducible part of Brillouin zone (in grey), and the coordinates of the ki points according to a Pack-Monkhorst sampling, with shrinking factor 3 and 6. ISP shrinking factor of reciprocal lattice vectors in the Gilat net (see [224], Chapter II.6). ISP is used in the calculation of the Fermi energy and density matrix. Its value can be equal to IS for insulating systems and equal to 2*IS for conducting systems. The value assigned to ISP is irrelevant for non-conductors. However, a non-conductor may give rise to a conducting structure at the initial stages of the SCF cycle (very often with DFT hamiltonians), owing, for instance, to a very unbalanced initial guess of the density matrix. The ISP parameter must therefore be deﬁned in all cases. Note. The value used in the calculation is ISP=IS*NINT(MAX(ISP,IS)/IS) In the following table the number of sampling points in the IBZ and in BZ is given for a fcc lattice (space group 225, 48 symmetry operators) and hcp lattice (space group 194, 24 symmetry operators).

Processing of the input block 1 only (geometry input) is allowed by the keyword TEST[GEOM]. Each keyword operates on the geometry active when the keyword is entered. For instance, when a 2D structure is generated from a 3D one through the keyword SLABCUT, all subsequent geometry editing operates on the 2D structure. When a dimer is extracted from a molecular crystal through the keyword MOLECULE, all subsequent editing refers to a system without translational symmetry. The keywords can be entered in any order: particular attention should be paid to the action of the keywords KEEPSYMM 3.1 and BREAKSYM 3.1, that allow maintaining or breaking the symmetry while editing the structure. These keywords behave as a switch, and require no further data. Under control of the BREAKSYM keyword (the default), subsequent modiﬁcations of the geometry are allowed to alter (reduce: the number of symmetry operators cannot be increased) the point-group sym- metry. The new group is a subgroup of the original group and is automatically obtained by CRYSTAL. However if a KEEPSYMM keyword is presented, the program will endeavor to maintain the number of symmetry operators, by requiring that atoms which are symmetry related remain so after a geometry editing (keywords: ATOMSUBS, ATOMINSE, ATOM- DISP, ATOMREMO).

BREAKSYM Under control of the BREAKSYM keyword (the default), subsequent modiﬁcations of the geometry are allowed to alter (reduce: the number of symmetry operators cannot be increased) the point-group symmetry. The new group is a subgroup of the original group and is automat- ically obtained by CRYSTAL. The symmetry may be broken by attributing diﬀerent spin (ATOMSPIN, block34, page 99) to atoms symmetry related by geometry. Example: When a CO molecule is vertically adsorbed on a (001) 3-layer MgO slab, (D4h symmetry), the symmetry is reduced to C4v, if the BREAKSYM keyword is active. The symmetry operators related to the σh plane are removed. However, if KEEPSYMM is active, then additional atoms will be added to the underside of the slab so as to maintain the σh plane (see page 41, keyword ATOMINSE). BREAKELAS (for 3D systems only) This keyword breaks the symmetry of 3D sysems according to a general distortion (3x3 adi- mensional matrix, not necessarily symmetric): rec variable value meaning • ∗D11 D12 D13 ﬁrst row of the matrix. • ∗D21 D22 D23 second row of the matrix. • ∗D31 D32 D33 third row of the matrix. BREAKELAS can be used when the symmetry must be reduced to apply an external stress not compatible with the present symmetry. BREAKELAS reduces the symmetry according to the distortion deﬁned in input, but does not perform a distortion of the lattice. Another possibility is when you compute elastic constants, and you want to ﬁx a reference geometry with FIXINDEX. If your reference geometry has a symmetry higher than the dis- torted one, then you had to break the symmetry by applying e.g. a tiny elastic distortion with ELASTIC. By using BREAKELAS you can reduce the symetry without distortion of the lattice.

ENDOPT CLUSTER - a cluster (0D) from a periodic system The CLUSTER option allows one to cut a ﬁnite molecular cluster of atoms from a periodic lattice. The size of the cluster (which is centred on a speciﬁed ’seed point’ A) can be controlled either by including all atoms within a sphere of a given radius centred on A, or by specifying a maximum number of symmetry-related stars of atoms to be included. The cluster includes the atoms B (belonging to diﬀerent cells of the direct lattice) satisfying the following criteria: 1. those which belong to one of the ﬁrst N (input data) stars of neighbours of the seed point of the cluster. and 2. those at a distance RAB from the seed point which is smaller then RMAX (input datum). The resulting cluster may not reproduce exactly the desired arrangement of atoms, particularly in crystals with complex structures such as zeolites, and so it is possible to specify border modiﬁcations to be made after deﬁnition of the core cluster.

The two kinds of possible modiﬁcation of the core cluster are (a) addition of further stars of neighbours to speciﬁed border atoms, and (b) saturation of the border atoms with hydrogen. This latter option can be essential in minimizing border electric ﬁeld eﬀects in calculations for covalently-bonded systems. (Substitution of atoms with hydrogen is obtained by HYDROSUB). The hydrogen saturation procedure is carried out in the following way. First, a coordination number for each atom is assumed (by default 4 for Si, 4 for Al and 2 for O, but these may be modiﬁed in the input deck for any atomic number). The actual number of neighbours of each speciﬁed border atom is then determined (according to a covalent radius criterion) and compared with the assumed connectivity. If these two numbers diﬀer, additional neighbours are added. If these atoms are not neighbours of any other existing cluster atoms, they are converted to hydrogen, otherwise further atoms are added until the connectivity allows complete hydrogen saturation whilst maintaining correct coordination numbers. The label of the IPAD atoms refers to the generated cluster, not to the original unit cell. The preparation of the input thus requires two runs: 1. run using the CLUSTER option with NMO=0, in order to generate the sequence number of the atoms in the core cluster. The keyword TESTGEOM should be inserted in the geometry input block. Setting NNA ̸= 0 in the input will print a coordination analysis of all core cluster atoms, including all neighbours within a distance RNNA (which should be set slightly greater than the maximum nearest neighbour bond length). This can be useful in deciding what border modiﬁcations are necessary. 2. run using the CLUSTER option with NMO ̸= 0, to perform desired border modiﬁca- tions. Note that the standard CRYSTAL geometry editing options may also be used to modify the cluster (for example by adding or deleting atoms) placing these keywords after the speciﬁcation of the CLUSTER input. Use keyword CLUSTER (46) to extend the number of atoms in the cluster if requested. Warning. The system is 0D. No reciprocal lattice information is required in the scf input (Section 2.3, page 32).

The eﬀect of a periodic electric ﬁeld ( ⃗ E) is taken into account according to a perturbation scheme. The Hamiltonian (Fock or Kohn-Sham) can be written as:: ˆ H = ˆ H0 + ˆ H1( ⃗ E) (3.1) where ˆ H0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian and ˆ H1( ⃗ E) the electric potential term. During the SCF procedure crystalline orbitals are relaxed under the eﬀect of the ﬁeld, leading to a perturbed wave function and charge density. The applied electric ﬁeld has a square-wave form, that corresponds to a triangular (”sawtooth”) electric potential. Due to the form of the potential, a single unit cell must contain both positive and negative part of the square wave electric ﬁeld. Then, in order to maintain translational invariance of the system a new, expanded, unit cell is automatically created by adopting a supercell approach (see keywords SUPERCEL/SUPERCON, page 75). This procedure consists in two automatic steps: the re-orientation of the c lattice parameter along the chosen ﬁeld direction and the multiplication of this lattice vector according to the supercell expansion factor (⃗ C=SMFACT·⃗ c, see ﬁg. 3.1). By varying this parameter is possible to control the period of the electric potential and therefore the length of the constant region of the electric ﬁeld. Then, for computational reasons, an automatic rotation of the crystal in the cartesian reference 49'},\n"," {'page_number': 49,\n","  'page_char_count': 2192,\n","  'page_word_count': 391,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 21,\n","  'page_token_count': 548.0,\n","  'text': 'Figure 3.1: Triangular electric potential (”sawtooth”) in a supercell with SMFACT = 4. system is performed by aligning ⃗ C (and therefore ⃗ E) along the z cartesian direction (see keyword ROTCRY, page 70).

In order to evaluate the dielectric constant of a material in the direction of the applied ﬁeld it is necessary to run a PROPERTIES calculation with the keyword DIEL (see page 318). In this way the perturbed wave function is used for the calculation of ϵ, following a macroscopic average scheme, as described in references [113], [59]. 2. The ﬁeld is along the z axis for 3D-crystal calculations; it is along the x for 1D-polymer and 2D-slab calculations. 3. In calculations of the dielectric constant, more accurate results can be achieved by in- creasing the SMFACT value. This will lead to systems characterized by a high number of atoms with large computational costs. The option IORTO = 0 allows to consider non-orthogonal supercells, characterized by the same dielectric properties of orthogonal cells, but with a lower number of atoms. 4. In 3D-crystals, the electric potential takes a triangular form to maintain translational symmetry and electric neutrality of cell. The symmetry of triangular potential has two options: a) ISYM=+1, triangular potential is symmetric with respect to the center of the su- percell, along the z axis. Use this option if there is a symmetry plane orthogonal to the z axis. b) ISYM=−1, triangular potential is anti-symmetric. This option can be used when the supercell does not have a symmetry plane orthogonal to z axis. 5. MUL, the number of terms in the Fourier expansion, can take values between 1 and 60. MUL=40 is suﬃcient to adequately reproduce the triangular shape of the potential. 50'},\n"," {'page_number': 50,\n","  'page_char_count': 2038,\n","  'page_word_count': 346,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 18,\n","  'page_token_count': 509.5,\n","  'text': 'Figure 3.2: Left: symmetric triangular electric potential (ISIM = 1).

For small gap cases, use of eigenvalue level shifting technique is recommended (keyword LEVSHIFT, page 118). 7. When an external ﬁeld is applied, the system can become conducting during the SCF procedure.

FULLE - Building a fullerene from a slab Fullerenes are molecular cage-like structures. An eﬀective way of constructing them exploiting all the possible symmetry is by starting from a 2D periodic ﬂat structure. In this ﬂat lattice, the vector R=n1 ⃗ a1+n2 ⃗ a2 (where ⃗ a1 and ⃗ a2 are the slab cell vectors) permits to deﬁne the side of a triangular face of the fullerene. Then, the indices (n1, n2) completely deﬁne the faces of the fullerene, and are used in the literature to characterise this type of systems. The case of a (2,2) carbon fullerene is given in ﬁgure 3.3 as an example. Once the face is deﬁned, the second key information is the type of polyhedron to be con- structed, and the corresponding point symmetry. CRYSTAL cuurently permits the automatic construction of the following combinations: • Icosahedron: I, Ih; • Octahedron: T, Td, Th, O, Oh; • Tetrahedron: T, Td.

NANOTUBE - Building a nanotube from a slab Nanotubes are cylindrical structures, periodic along one direction. They are therefore charac- terised by a single lattice vector. However, in order to study their symmetry and orientation, it is easier to start from a 2D lattice where the additional periodicity becomes the cylinder period. This 2D periodic ﬂat structure will be referred in the following, as the nanotube ﬂat lattice. In this ﬂat lattice, 3 vectors are important for the structure description: the rolling vector, ⃗ R, the longitudinal vector, ⃗ L and the helical vector, ⃗ H. • The rolling vector, ⃗ R = n1 ⃗ a1+n2 ⃗ a2 (where ⃗ a1 and ⃗ a2 are the slab cell vectors), is suﬃcient to completely deﬁne a nanotube. It is used in the literature to characterise the systems (for example the (4,3) nanotube is a nanotube with a rolling vector ⃗ R = 4 ⃗ a1+3 ⃗ a2). In the ﬂat nanotube lattice, ⃗ R is a nanotube unit cell vector. Once the nanotube wrapped, the rolling vector becomes a circle normal to the cylinder axis; its norm corresponds to the cylinder perimeter. If ⃗ R passes N times through the lattice nodes, a N-order rotational axis will exist along the corresponding nanotube axis. • The longitudinal vector, ⃗ L = l1 ⃗ a1 + l2 ⃗ a2, is the shortest lattice vector normal to ⃗ R. In the nanotube, it becomes the 1D lattice parameter and gives the 1D periodicity along the tube axis. • The helical vector, ⃗ H = h1 ⃗ a1+h2 ⃗ a2, is a lattice vector deﬁning with ⃗ R an area which is N times the area of the unit cell of the ﬂat slab. It satisﬁes, then, the following relationship S(⃗ R, ⃗ H) S( ⃗ a1, ⃗ a2) = |n1h2 −n2h1| = N (3.6) where S(⃗ vi, ⃗ vj) is the surface deﬁned by the ⃗ vi and ⃗ vj vectors. The helical vector deﬁnes a correspondence between a translation in the ﬂat slab and a roto-translation in the curved surface; ⃗ H has a rotational component along the circumference vector and a translational component along the lattice parameter. The direct product between the rotational and roto-translational operations generates the full symmetry of the nanotube. The three vectors listed previously are represented in ﬁgure 3.4 for graphene; the example refers to the construction of a (4,2) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). Further information about the implemented method, the computational costs and the symme- try features of nanotubes are found in Ref. [58] and [290, 12].

NANOTUBE can be used with the following 2D systems: • square and hexagonal lattices: any (n1, n2) combination • rectangular lattices: any n1, n2 = 0 • rhombohedral lattices: n2 = ±n1 In the other cases, the existence of a lattice vector perpendicular to ⃗ R (so the 1D periodicity along the tube axis) is not guaranteed. The orthogonality condition between ⃗ R and ⃗ L provides the following equation: ⃗ L · ⃗ R = (l1 ⃗ a1 + l2 ⃗ a2) · (n1 ⃗ a1 + n2 ⃗ a2) = n1l1| ⃗ a1|2 + n2l2| ⃗ a2|2 + (n1l2 + n2l1)| ⃗ a1|| ⃗ a2|cos(γ) = 0(3.7) γ being the angle between ⃗ a1 and ⃗ a2. From Equation 3.7 one obtains: l1 l2 = −n2|a2|2 + n1|a1||a2|cos(γ) n1|a1|2 + n2|a1||a2|cos(γ) (3.8) If the right term is divided and multiplied by |a2|2, one obtains l1 l2 = − n2 + n1aqcos(γ) aq(n1aq + n2cos(γ)) (3.9) with aq = |a1| |a2|. 60'},\n"," {'page_number': 60,\n","  'page_char_count': 2228,\n","  'page_word_count': 408,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 17,\n","  'page_token_count': 557.0,\n","  'text': 'The above equation cannot be satisﬁed for any ( ⃗ a1, ⃗ a2,cos(γ)) combination. This observation is based on the fact that, as l1 and l2 are integers, l1 l2 is a rational number, whereas, in general, cos(γ) and aq are real numbers. In the following the ﬁve 2D Bravais lattices are considered separately, in order to show which conditions satisfy the periodicity along the tube axis and which do not. • Hexagonal lattice: ⃗ a1 = ⃗ a2, cos(γ) = ±1/2. Equation 3.9 becomes: l1 l2 = −n2 + n1/2 n1 + n2/2 = −2n2 + n1 2n1 + n2 (3.10) Any roll-up vector is possible. • Square lattice: ⃗ a1 = ⃗ a2, cos(γ) = 0. l1 l2 = −n2 n1 (3.11) Any roll-up vector is possible. • Rectangular lattice: ⃗ a1 ̸= ⃗ a2, cos(γ) = 0. l1 l2 = −n2|a2|2 n1|a1|2 (3.12) In this case the right term corresponds to a rational number either if |a1| = n|a2|, with n being a rational number, or if n2=0. More generally, for rectangular lattices, the periodicity along the tube axis is always satisﬁed for (n, 0) and (0, n) roll-up vectors. • Rhombohedral (centred rectangular) lattice: ⃗ a1 = ⃗ a2, any cos(γ). l1 l2 = −n2 + n1cos(γ) n1 + n2cos(γ) (3.13) The right term provides a rational number only when n1 = n2 or n1 = −n2, so that Equation 3.13 becomes: l1 l2 = −n1[1 + cos(γ)] n1[1 + cos(γ)] = −1 l1 l2 = n1[1 −cos(γ)] n1[1 −cos(γ)] = 1 (3.14) • Oblique lattice: ⃗ a1 ̸= ⃗ a2, any cos(γ). Equation 3.9 remains as such, and the right term is always an irrational number. When the above conditions are not satisﬁed, however, it is possible to manipulate the geometry of the starting slab and force it to assume a suitable form, by building supercells or with minor modiﬁcations to the cell parameters. Note that, in cases of hexagonal lattices, the standard convention adopted in CRYSTAL con- siders the reference ﬂat lattice cell vectors forming a 120◦angle. In the carbon nanotube literature, however, the rolling indices refer to a 60◦angle. For this reason, the same input can be obtained with the following choices, where the (6,3) indices in the 60◦unit cell become (9,3) in the 120◦option: Example I: (6,3) SWCNT from graphene, 60 degrees SLAB 1 2.47 2.47 60.000 2 6 0.33333333333 0.33333333333 0.000 6 -0.33333333333 -0.33333333333 0.000 NANOTUBE 6 3 61'},\n"," {'page_number': 61,\n","  'page_char_count': 2815,\n","  'page_word_count': 461,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 19,\n","  'page_token_count': 703.75,\n","  'text': 'Example II: (6,3) SWCNT from graphene, default choice SLAB 77 2.47 1 6 0.333333 0.666667 0.000000 NANOTUBE 9 3 In order to avoid ambiguity in the choice of the carbon nanotubes indices, use the SWCNT (page 77) keyword. Nanotube rebuild: build a nanotube starting from the structure of another one, with same directions but a diﬀerent radius. Two restart keywords, NANORE (page 58) and SWCNTRE(page 77), allow to build a (n1, n2) nanotube by starting from the structure of another one (a previously (nold1, nold2) optimised one, read from ﬁle fort.35). The ”old” nanotube is unrolled and re-rolled according to a ”new” ⃗ R vector, with minor modiﬁcations to the structure. The rolling direction of the two tubes must be the same. It is particularly helpful for the geometry optimisation of inorganic nanotubes (thick slabs, large systems, the geometry of the tubes is very diﬀerent from the one of the slab), as the number of optimisation steps is reduced (see Ref. [61] for documentation of computational gain). NANOMULTI - Building a multi-wall nanotube from a layer slab From a 2D periodic ﬂat structure, previously referred as the nanotube ﬂat lattice, multi-wall nanotubes can be wrapped, with M ≥2, adopting the same procedure and conventions outlined for the single-wall materials.3.1 In particular, it is possibile to specify for each wall a couple of indices (n1, n2) which univocally determines the rolling vector, ⃗ R, the longitudinal vector, ⃗ L and the helical vector, ⃗ H, of the tube, that is all its structural features. The construction of each wall is introduced by the keyword WALL and the OPTWALL option allows its full geometry optimization, as if it were an isolated nanotube. The ﬁnal energy of this calculation can be used as a reference for the isolated system and as a ﬁrst estimate of the inter-wall energy. The density matrices at convergence of the isolated walls, each saved on the ﬁle DENSMATM.BIN, can be used as the initial guess for constructing the density matrix of the whole structure. This procedure is activated by the keyword GUESSMULTI and can at time facilitate convergence. Then, by means of the OPTMULTI keyword the full optimization of the M-wall structure is performed. Some structural manipulations can be accomplished by using two additional keywords within the WALL block: ROTWALL and TRANSWALL. With the ﬁrst, the nanotube is rotated around the periodic x-axis of a given angle, between 0◦and 360◦. It is worth to mention that rotations of a few degrees often already reproduce the same initial conﬁguration. TRANSWALL performs a rigid displacement along the x-axis of the atomic position of the selected wall. Both options can be used together and in association with optimization keywords to study the eﬀect of diﬀerent stacking of tubes on various properties. 62'},\n"," {'page_number': 62,\n","  'page_char_count': 1650,\n","  'page_word_count': 305,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 2,\n","  'page_token_count': 412.5,\n","  'text': 'rec variable meaning • ∗NANOMULTI • ∗M number of walls to wrap starting from the same layer slab insert M records • ∗WALL • ∗m number of the wall, 1 < m < M • ∗ROLLINGV • ∗n1, n2 components of the roll-up-vector of the nanotube in the slab unit cell basis: ⃗ R = n1 ⃗ a1+n2 ⃗ a2, being a1 and a2 the cell vectors of the original 2D slab.

The introduction of such penalty function should prevent the onset of harmful linear dependence that can give rise to numerical instabilities and unphysical states. The optimization of the entire basis set is a formidable task and quite likely to be not very useful. Therefore the users can select from the basis set (the basis set must be written explicitly in the input) which functions they want to optimize The shells involved in the optimization must be highlighted by a star * in the input basis set. e.g.: ... 0 0 1 0 1 * 1.2429415962 1.0000000 ... Suggestions: since the valence shells are usually the ones involved in the chemical bonding, these are the ones usually to be optimized. For less expert users, it is recommended to optimize only exponents and if possible it is also suggested to uncontract the shells if not already.

SUPERCEL rec variable meaning • ∗E expansion matrix E (IDIMxIDIM elements, input by rows: 9 reals (3D); 4 reals (2D); 1 real (1D) A supercell is obtained by deﬁning the new unit cell vectors as linear combinations of the primitive cell unit vectors (See SUPERCON for crystallographic cell vectors reference). The point symmetry is deﬁned by the number of symmetry operators in the new cell. It may be reduced, not increased. The new translation vectors b′ 1, b′ 2, b′ 3 are deﬁned in terms of the old vectors b1, b2, b3 and of the matrix E, read in input by rows, as follows: b′ 1 = e11 · b1 + e12 · b2 + e13 · b3 b′ 2 = e21 · b1 + e22 · b2 + e23 · b3 b′ 3 = e31 · b1 + e32 · b2 + e33 · b3 The symmetry is automatically reduced to the point symmetry operators without translational components and a further reduction of the symmetry is also possible. Before building the supercell, the origin is shifted in order to minimize the number of sym- metry operators with translational components (see page 23). To avoid this operation, insert NOSHIFT before SUPERCEL Atoms that are related by translational symmetry in the unit cell are considered nonequivalent in a supercell. The supercell option is a useful starting point for the study of defective systems, of chemisorp- tion and anti ferromagnetism, by combining the SUPERCELoption with the options de- scribed in this chapter: ATOMREMO (page 42), ATOMSUBS (page 43), ATOMINSE (page 41), ATOMDISP (page 41), SLAB (page 71). To study anti ferromagnetic (AFM) states, it may be necessary to generate a supercell, and then attribute diﬀerent spin to atoms related by translational symmetry (ATOMSPIN, input block 3, page 99).

Useful to create a vacancy (Test 37), leaving the variational freedom to the defective region and to evaluate the basis set superposition error (BSSE), in a periodic system. The periodic structure is maintained, and the energy of the isolated components computed, leaving the basis set of the other one(s) unaltered. For instance, the energy of a mono-layer of CO molecules on top of a MgO surface can be evaluated including the basis functions of the ﬁrst layer of MgO, or, vice-versa, the energy of the MgO slab including the CO ad-layer basis functions.

The data deﬁning the pseudo-potentials where in- cluded in CRYSTAL92, and never modiﬁed. The keyword INPUT allows entering updated pseudo-potentials, when available. An a posteriori check has been possible for HAYWLC and HAYWSC only, as the total energy of the atoms for the suggested conﬁguration and basis set has been published [142, 141]. Agreement with published atomic energies data is satisfactory (checked from Na to Ba) for Hay and Wadt small core and large core pseudo- potentials, when using the suggested basis sets. The largest diﬀerence is of the order of 10−3 hartree. For Durand and Barthelat the atomic energies are not published, therefore no check has been performed. The printed data should be carefully compared with those in the original papers. The authors of the ECP should be contacted in doubtful cases. Only the FR COLUSC, COLULC, COLUSH, STUTSC, STUTLC and STUTSH li- braries include spin-orbit SOREP operators in their deﬁnition. The Columbus potentials COLUSC, COLULC and COLUSH [102, 150, 163, 242, 243, 99, 193] are shape-consistent FR potentials obtained from adjustment to Dirac-Fock calculations, employing the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. The Stuttgart-Cologne potentials STUTSC, STUTLC and STUTSH [188, 189, 263, 213, 107, 170, 171, 214, 212, 69, 288, 136, 135, 137] are energy-consistent FR potentials obtained from adjustment to multiconﬁgurational Dirac-Fock calculations, employing the low-frequency or frequency-dependent Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. If both the Columbus and Stuttgart-Cologne potentials are available for a calculation, then it is usually recommended to use the Stuttgart-Cologne one. The Stuttgart-Cologne potentials usually have a smaller core than the Columbus ones and are usually obtained by adjustment to models including more accurate approximations to the relativistic electron-electron interaction. We note that the many-body core-polarization operators of the STUTLC potentials have not been implemented. Valence Basis set and pseudopotentials Hay and Wadt ([142, 141]) have published basis sets suitable for use with their small and large core pseudopotentials. and in those basis set the s and p gaussian functions with the same quantum number have diﬀerent exponent.

The computational advantage of pseudopotentials over all-electron sets may thus be considerably reduced. Basis set equivalent to those suggested by Hay and Wadt can be optimized by using CRYSTAL as an atomic package (page 98), or any atomic package with eﬀective core pseudopotentials. See Chapter 17 for general comments on atomic basis function optimization. Bouteiller et al [31] have published a series of basis sets optimized for Durand and Barthelat ECPs. As for the Columbus and Stuttgart-Cologne ECP libraries, molecular basis sets are available online in clickable periodic tables at: http://people.clarkson.edu/~pchristi/reps.html http://www.tc.uni-koeln.de/PP/clickpse.en.html These molecular basis sets can often be modiﬁed for calculations in periodic system by decon- tracting them and (possibly) removing the most diﬀuse functions. Stuttgart-Dresden ECP (formerly STOLL and PREUSS ECP) The most recent pseudopotential parameters, optimized basis sets, a list of references and guidelines for the choice of the pseudopotentials can be found in: http://www.theochem.uni-stuttgart.de/pseudopotentials/index.en.html The clickable periodic table supplies, in CRYSTAL format, ECP to be used in CRYSTAL via the INPUT keyword (basis set input, block2, page 84). http://www.theochem.uni-stuttgart.de/pseudopotentials/clickpse.en.html The STUTSC, STUTLC (and STUTSH) internal libraries correspond to the so-called “ECPXXMDF” (“ECPXXMDFQ”), as avalable at the address http://www.theochem.uni- stuttgart.de/pseudopotentials/index.en.html, where XX denotes the eﬀective core charge.

ATOMHF - Atomic wave function calculation The Hartree-Fock atomic wave functions for the symmetry unique atoms in the cell are com- puted by the atomic program [240]. Full input (geometry, basis set, general information, SCF) is processed. No input data are required. The density matrix, constructed from a superpo- sition of atomic densities, is computed and written on Fortran unit 9, along with the wave function information. The crystal program then stops. It is then possible to compute charge density (ECHG) and classical electrostatic potential (CLAS) maps by running the program properties. This option is an alternative to the keyword PATO in the program properties (page 348), when the calculation of the periodic wave function is not required. The atomic wave function, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can be printed by setting the printing option 71. 1. The atomic basis set may include diﬀuse functions, as no periodic calculation is carried out. 2. A maximum of two open shells of diﬀerent symmetry (s, p, d) are allowed in the electronic conﬁguration. In the electronic conﬁguration given in input the occupation number of the shells must follow the rules given in Section 2.2. 3. For each electronic conﬁguration, the highest multiplicity state is computed. Multiplicity cannot be chosen by the user. Warning: DFT wave function for isolated atoms can not be computed. 98'},\n"," {'page_number': 98,\n","  'page_char_count': 2752,\n","  'page_word_count': 485,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 17,\n","  'page_token_count': 688.0,\n","  'text': 'ATOMSPIN - Setting of atomic spin rec variable meaning • ∗NA number of atoms to attribute a spin • ∗LA,LS(LA),L=1,NA atom labels and spin (1, 0, -1) The setting of the atomic spins is used to compute the density matrix as superposition of atomic densities (GUESSPAT must be SCF initial guess); it does not work with GUESSP). The symmetry of the lattice may be reduced by attributing a diﬀerent spin to geometrically symmetry related atoms. In such cases a previous symmetry reduction should be performed using the MODISYMM keyword. The program checks the symmetry taking the spin of the atoms into account. If the spin pattern does not correspond to the symmetry, the program prints information on the new symmetry, and then stops. The formal spin values are given as follows: 1 atom spin is taken to be alpha; 0 atom spin is irrelevant; -1 atom spin is taken to be beta. In a NiO double-cell (four atoms, Ni1 Ni2 O1 O2) we might use: atom Ni1 Ni2 spin 1 1 for starting ferromagnetic solutions: ↑↑ spin 1 -1 for starting anti ferromagnetic solutions: ↑↓ SPINLOCK forces a given nα −nβ electrons value: to obtain a correct atomic spin density to start SCF process, the atomic spins must be set even for the ferromagnetic solution.

BETALOCK - Spin-polarized solutions rec variable meaning • ∗INF97 nβ electrons ∗INF98 number of cycles the nβ electrons is maintained The total number of of β electrons at all k points can be locked at the input value. The number of α electrons is locked to (N + INF95)/2, where N is the total number of electrons in the unit cell. INF95 must be odd when the number of electrons is odd, even when the number of electrons is even. See SPINLOCK for alternative way to deﬁne spin setting. Note: if INF98 is < 0, then the lock duration is controlled by energy diﬀerence between successive cycles (disappears when < 10−INF 98) instead of by number of cycles. This is useful when the locking must be relaxed before the convergence of the SCF -otherwise there is a risk to arrive to a spurious solution- but at the same time one does not know exactly in which SCF cycle the density matrix can be considered to be close enough to the right electronic structure so as to avoid a divergent behavior after the locking ﬁnishes. Situations like this may occur in geometry optimizations of ferromagnetic systems, for instance: the SCF of the ﬁrst optimization point converges in CYC 20 with the locking ﬁnishing in CYC 12; in the remaining points, as the density matrix of the previous one is used as initial guess, the SCF converges in CYC 10 under locking and, so, the true convergence is not ensured. Using FINALRUN=4 this situation could lead to an extremely large or even non convergent optimization process. 99'},\n"," {'page_number': 99,\n","  'page_char_count': 2313,\n","  'page_word_count': 388,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 12,\n","  'page_token_count': 578.25,\n","  'text': 'On the other hand, to ﬁx locking since the energy diﬀerence between cycles is less than a given threshold is a quite handy criterion that could be in several cases preferable than ﬁxing the duration in terms of number of cycles.

DIIS – Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace convergence accel- erator The Direct Inversion of Invariant Subspace (DIIS) is a powerful technique to accelerate the SCF convergence that gained success in recent years. Initially proposed by Pulay in 1984 for SCF convergence,[236, 234] it gained considerable reputation during the last 30 years. In Crystal22 this feature is activated by default in sequential and parallel, while it is deactiated by default in MPPcrystal runs.

Cycle n starts with the deﬁnition of a density matrix Dn(k), either obtained as an initial guess (at cycle 0) or from eigenvectors of the previous cycle. A Fock matrix Fn(k) is then obtained from this density matrix, and then diagonalized in each k point to obtain eigenvectors Cn(k). These will form the Dn+1(k) density matrices and so on. In the DIIS procedure, at each iterative cycle n, instead of the Fock matrix Fn(k), an averaged eﬀective Hamiltonian is generated as a linear combination of the Fock matrices of previous iterations: Fn = n X i=1 ciFi . (3.30) The ci coeﬃcients are obtained by minimizing a suitable error functional e, subject to the constraint that Pn i=1 ci = 1. This is obtained by solving the linear equation system: \\x12 e 1T 1 0 \\x13 \\x12 c λ \\x13 = \\x12 0 1 \\x13 , (3.31) where e is an error matrix having the size of the iterative space up to cycle n and λ is a Lagrange multiplier. The error matrix is deﬁned through scalar products of suitable error vectors in each k point of the Brillouin zone: enm = X k fk < en(k)|em(k) > . (3.32) where k-dependent factors fk are introduced. - By default, only gamma point is used in DIIS (DIIS1K), and in this case fk = 1 and no summation is performed over k points. - Sum can be extended to all k points, with factors set all equal to 1/Nk, by using the keyword DIISALLK. - The keyword SLOSHING is similar to DIISALLK, but diﬀerent weights for diﬀerent k-points are used, according to Kerker’s formula According to Pulay’s commutator-DIIS (CDIIS) formulation,[234] we deﬁne the error vector for the SCF procedure as: en(k) = Fn(k)Dn(k)S(k) −S(k)Dn(k)Fn(k) , (3.33) where S(k) is the overlap matrix. The CDIIS formulation is particularly convenient because it allows the number of occupied orbitals in a given k point to vary during iterations.

The additional electronic charge is added after the ﬁrst diagonalization of the SCF procedure. If the resulting cell is not neutral, a uniform compensating charge background is added auto- matically (similarly to keyword CHARGED, page 80). At diﬀerence with CHEMOD, through this keyword it is possible to add a fractional amount of electrons to a periodic cell, obtaining equivalent results with respect to adding one electron to an appropriate supercell of the original cell. Warning: when adding a fractional number of electrons to a cell, particular care must be taken in verifying that the sampling of reciprocal space is well converged. The appropriate value of the shrinking factor for such a system is in some cases several times larger than for the neutral cell, and is dependent on the amount of charge doping. EIGS - Check of basis set linear dependence In order to check the risk of basis set linear dependence, it is possible to calculate the eigenvalues of the overlap matrix. Full input (geometry, basis set, general information, SCF) is processed. No input data are required. The overlap matrix in reciprocal space is computed at all the k- points generated in the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone, and diagonalized. The eigenvalues are printed. The higher the numerical accuracy obtained by severe computational conditions, the closer to 0 can be the eigenvalues without risk of numerical instabilities. Negative values indicate numerical linear dependence. The crystal program stops after the check (even if negative eigenvalues are not detected).

This option is particularly useful in situations involving d orbital degeneracies which are not broken by the small distortions due to the crystal ﬁeld, but which are broken by some higher-order eﬀects (e.g. spin-orbit coupling). The EIGSHIFT option may be used to artiﬁcially remove the degeneracy in order to drive the system to a stable, non-metallic solution. The eigenvalue shift is removed after the ﬁrst SCF cycle. If the shift has to be applied to matrix elements of atoms symmetry related, the input data must be repeated as many times as the atoms symmetry related. Example: KCoF3 (test 38). In the cubic environment, two β electrons would occupy the three- fold degenerate t2g bands.

The total energy is given by EDF T −D = EKS−DF T + Edisp where Edisp, the empirical dispersion correction, is given as Edisp = −s6 Nat−1 X i=1 Nat X j=i+1 X g Cij 6 Rij,g fdump(Rij,g) The summation is over all atom pairs and g lattice vectors with the exclusion of the i=j contribution (i.e. self interaction) for g = 0, Cij 6 is the dispersion coeﬃcient for the atom pair ij, s6 is a scaling factor that depends only on the adopted DFT method (e.g. s6 is 1.05 for B3LYP) and Rij,g is the interatomic distance between atoms i in the reference cell and j in the neighbouring cells at distance |g|. For a set of molecular crystals, a cutoﬀdistance of 25.0 ˚ A was used to truncate the summation over lattice vectors which corresponds to an estimated error of less than 0.02 kJ/mol on computed cohesive energies with respect to larger cutoﬀs [50, 51]. A damping function is used to avoid near-singularities for small interatomic distances: fdump(Rij,g)= 1 1+exp−d(Rij,g/Rvdw−) where Rvdw is the sum of atomic van der Waals radii (i.e. Rvdw = Ri vdw + Rj vdw) and d determines the steepness of the damping function (d = 20). Van der Waals radii and atomic C6 coeﬃcients were taken from Table 1 of ref. [125].

HIRSHCHG/HIRSHBLK - Iterative Hirshfeld Population Analysis The Hirshfeld-I analysis of atomic charge/electron population analysis is performed at the end of the SCF calculation. There are two possible strategies for the input structure. A black- block form, ruled by the HIRSHCHG keyword, after which no input data are required and the default conditions concerning spatial integration and convergence are considered for computation of the atomic populations. And a second form in which a block, introduced by the keyword HIRSHBLK and completed by the keyword END, does contain several particular settings for the calculation of the Hirshfeld-I populations. In particular, the charge integration grid and the parameters of the iterative procedure can be redeﬁned by the keywords described below. Grids for charge integration Integration in Hirshfeld-I exploits approaches similar to those considered in the DFT integration scheme (see page 143). The predeﬁned options, that can be eventually used, are the followings: SGRID: Small grid (default) This grid correspond to a relatively cheap one that is in general enough for the evaluation of Hirshfeld-I electron population. It is equivalent to OLDGRID (see page 145).

The ATMOL package can compute integrals over functions of any quantum number, but the symmetry treatment implemented in the CRYSTAL package allows usage of s, p and d functions only.

ILOCK 0 no locking 1 causes a lock in a particular state (eg non-conducting) even if the so- lution during the SCF cycles would normally pass through or even con- verge to a conducting state. The eigenvalue level shifting technique is well known in molecular studies [132, 52], and may also be used for periodic systems. The technique involves the addition of a negative energy shift to the diagonal Fock/KS matrix elements (in the Crystalline Orbital basis) of the occupied orbitals and thus reducing their coupling to the “unoccupied” set. This shift may be main- tained (ILOCK=1) or removed (ILOCK=0) after diagonalization. The former case causes a lock in a particular state (eg non- conducting) even if the solution during the SCF cycles would normally pass through or even converge to a conducting state. This option provides an alternative damping mechanism to Fock/KS matrix mixing (FMIX- ING, page 110). The locking is eﬀective only if ISHIFT is large enough. If locking is used, the Fermi energy and the eigenvalues are depressed by the value of the level shifter. Suggested values : 1. Normal cases require no mixing of Fock/KS matrices in successive cycles to converge: ISHIFT=0 (default). 2. When 20% to 30% mixing of Fock/KS matrices is necessary, an ISHIFT value of between 1 and 3 (giving a level shift of 0.1 to 0.3 hartree) may produce an equivalent or even superior convergence rate. 3. If serious convergence diﬃculties are encountered, ISHIFT=10 will normally be adequate, corresponding to a level shift of 1 hartree. But it may happen that the system moves towards an excited state, and no convergence is obtained. Warning - Hamiltonian eigenvalues are modiﬁed by the level shifter.

A simple input example is here reported: for more details about how to run a Cryscor calculation please refer to Cryscor User’s Manual[92] and to Cryscor web page: www.cryscor.unito.it. The post-HF method currently implemented is a perturbative method, namely Møller-Plesset at the second-order (MP2). Well localized Wannier Functions (WF) [309] are adopted instead of delocalized Bloch functions for the description of the occupied manifold; this permits the exploitation of the short-range nature (E ∝r−6) of electron correlation following the general Pulay scheme[235]. An MP2 correction to the HF Density Matrix is feasible so that many of the Properties can be currently evaluated taking into account the eﬀects of the dynamic correlation. The code has been widely used to study, among others, the structure and stability of diﬀerent polymorph,[44, 94] the energetic balance in van der Waals and hydrogen-bonded crystals,[184] interactions between molecules and surfaces,[179] and the upshot of electron correlation on some fundamental properties such as vibrational spectra,[87] electron density and Compton proﬁles.[96] Note that the localization procedure and the MP2 technique implemented in Cryscor are not suitable for open-shell systems, for conductors, or for semicon- ductors with very small gap. 120'},\n"," {'page_number': 120,\n","  'page_char_count': 2034,\n","  'page_word_count': 312,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 20,\n","  'page_token_count': 508.5,\n","  'text': 'MYBIPOLA - Bipolar expansion approximation control rec variable meaning • ∗ ILCOUL maximum multipole order for Coulomb 4 ∗ ITCOUL overlap threshold for Coulomb 14 ∗ IFCOUL reducing factor for Coulomb 90 • ∗ ILEXCH maximum multipole order for exchange 2 ∗ ITEXCH overlap threshold for exchange 10 ∗ IFEXCH reducing factor for exchange 70 The bipolar approximation is applied in the evaluation of the Coulomb and exchange integrals (page 404).

There are three main diﬀerences with respect to UHF: (1) only alpha electrons are allowed to be assigned to singly occupied states, (2) the imposed occupancy constraint allows the ROHF approach to provide solutions that are eigenfunctions of the spin operator, c S2, and (3) solutions are in general less stable than those obtained with the UHF method. It is important to underline that ROHF solutions never exhibit locally negative spin densities. In CRYSTAL the symmetry adaption of the crystal (molecular) orbitals is disabled for the ROHF method.

The value of IS determines the number of k points at which the Fock/KS matrix is diagonalized. Multiples of 2 or 3 should be used, according to the point symmetry of the system (order of principal axes). In high symmetry systems, it is convenient to assign IS magic values such that all low multiplicity (high symmetry) points belong to the Monkhorst lattice. Although this choice does not correspond to maximum eﬃciency, it gives a safer estimate of the integral. The k-points net is automatically made anisotropic for 1D and 2D systems.

However, a non-conductor may give rise to a conducting structure at the initial stages of the SCF cycle, owing, for instance, to a very unbalanced initial guess of the density matrix.

SPINEDIT - Editing of the spin density matrix rec variable meaning • ∗N number of atoms for which spin must be reversed • ∗LB, L=1,N atom labels The spin density matrix from a previous run is edited to generate an approximate guess for a new spin conﬁguration. The sign of the elements of the spin density matrix of selected atoms is reversed. The keyword SPINEDIT must be combined with UHF (input block 3, page 131) or DFT/SPIN (input block 3, page 140) and GUESSP. Example: the anti ferromagnetic solution for the spinel MnCr2O4 can be obtained by calculat- ing the ferro magnetic solution, and using as guess to start the SCF process the density matrix of the ferromagnetic solution with reversed signs on selected atoms. SPINLOCK - Spin-polarized solutions rec variable meaning • ∗NSPIN nα-nβ electrons ∗NCYC number of cycles the diﬀerence is maintained The diﬀerence between the number of α and β electrons at all k points can be locked at the input value. The number of α electrons is locked to (N + NSPIN)/2, where N is the total number of electrons in the unit cell; the number of β electrons is locked to (N - NSPIN)/2. NSPIN must be odd when the number of electrons is odd, even when the number of electrons is even. Example. Bulk NiO. If a anti ferromagnetic solution is required, a double cell containing 2 NiO units must be considered (test 30). The two Ni atoms, related by translational symmetry, are considered nonequivalent. The number of electron is 72, each Ni ion is expected to have two unpaired electrons. INF95 type of solution corresponding to the spin setting 0 anti ferromagnetic ↑↓↑↓ 4 ferromagnetic ↑↑↑↑ Warning To lock the diﬀerence between α and β electrons α and β eigenvalues are forced to be split. Their printed value is meaningless, until locking is active. See tests 29, 30, 32, 33, 37, 38. Note: if NCYC is < 0, then the lock duration is controlled by energy diﬀerence between successive cycles (disappears when < 10−NCY C) instead of by number of cycles. This is useful when the locking must be relaxed before the convergence of the SCF -otherwise there is a risk to arrive to a spurious solution- but at the same time one does not know exactly in which SCF cycle the density matrix can be considered to be close enough to the right electronic structure so as to avoid a divergent behavior after the locking ﬁnishes. Situations like this may occur in geometry optimizations of ferromagnetic systems, for instance: the SCF of the ﬁrst optimization point converges in CYC 20 with the locking ﬁnishing in CYC 12; in the remaining points, as the density matrix of the previous one is used as initial guess, the SCF converges in CYC 10 under locking and, so, the true convergence is not ensured. 128'},\n"," {'page_number': 128,\n","  'page_char_count': 2510,\n","  'page_word_count': 409,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 23,\n","  'page_token_count': 627.5,\n","  'text': 'Using FINALRUN=4 this situation could lead to an extremely large or even non convergent optimization process.

This allows the system to pass through or converge to a conducting state while the locking is active. Additionally, it is possible to set the value of SPIN to a real number. Using this keyword the energies for the top of virtual and bottom of valence band , as well as the band gap, are printed for both α and β electrons. These values are not meaningless as in the case of SPINLOCK but should be interpreted with care, since if the spin state is unstable there may be α occupied states at higher energy with respect to β virtual states or vice versa.

[220]). In the Restricted Open Shell [241] Hamiltonian, the same set of molecular (i.e. crystalline) orbitals describes alpha and beta electrons; levels can be doubly occupied (by one alpha and one beta electron, as in the RHF closed shell approach), singly occupied or left vacant. The wave-function is multi-determinantal; in the special case of half-closed shell systems, where we can deﬁne a set of orbitals occupied by paired electrons and a second set occupied by electrons with parallel spins, the wave-function is formed by a single determinant. Another mono-determinantal approach for the study of open-shell systems is the UHF method [230]. In this theory, the constraint of double occupancy is absent and α electrons are allowed to populate orbitals other than those occupied by the β electrons. Energy levels corresponding to a ROHF and UHF description are plotted in ﬁg. 3.6. The double occupancy constraint allows the ROHF approach to obtain solutions that are eigen- functions of the spin operator, c S2, whereas UHF solutions are formed by a mixture of spin states. The greater variational freedom allows the UHF method to produce wave-functions that are energetically more stable than the corresponding ROHF ones; another advantage of the UHF method is that it allows solutions with locally negative spin density (i.e. anti ferromagnetic systems), a feature that ROHF solutions can never exhibit. ROHF solution is not supported by CRYSTAL any more.

SPIN unrestricted spin DF calculation (default: restricted) Self-consistent Hybrids For a long time, hybrid functionals (either global or screened-exchange) have been characterized by a ﬁxed, system-independent Fock exchange fraction α (0.2 in B3LYP and B3PW91, 0.25 in PBE0 and HSE06, 0.16 in B1WC, for instance). Many properties of solids turn out to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the α parameter, which makes the identiﬁcation of its optimal value both conceptually and practically important. For instance, it is known that the electronic band structure of small or large band gap solids is better reproduced by use of smaller or larger values of α, respectively. In recent years, the use of a system-speciﬁc optimal Fock fraction, as linked to the static elec- tronic screening of the system, has been proposed, whose practical prescription implies deﬁning α as inversely proportional to the static electronic dielectric constant ϵ∞of the material. The dielectric constants entering the deﬁnition of these functionals have been either taken from the experiment or computed with diﬀerent techniques. In this respect, Skone et al. [Phys. Rev. 140'},\n"," {'page_number': 140,\n","  'page_char_count': 2704,\n","  'page_word_count': 395,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 15,\n","  'page_token_count': 676.0,\n","  'text': 'Figure 4.1: Flow chart of the automated algorithm for the system-speciﬁc deﬁnition of self- consistent hybrid functionals, as implemented in Crystal17. B 89, 195112 (2014)] have recently proposed a promising iterative scheme for the calculation of the optimal Fock exchange fraction of global hybrids, where the static electronic dielectric response of the material and α are self-consistently determined. Self-consistent hybrids are becoming popular in solid state applications mainly because of their reliable description of the electronic band structure and some optical properties. The system-speciﬁc character of self-consistent hybrid functionals on the one hand has the advantage of bringing into the exchange-correlation functional the electronic screening proper of the material but, on the other hand, it makes it necessary to determine α for each system as a pre-step to any calculation, which implies a higher computational cost and a reduced user-friendliness compared to standard hybrids, unless computationally-eﬃcient, automated strategies are devised for their deﬁnition. In Crystal17, a fully-automated (i.e. requiring a single calculation), computationally-eﬃcient implementation of self-consistent hybrid functionals has been implemented. The static elec- tronic dielectric tensor of the system is computed by adopting a Coupled-Perturbed-Hartree- Fock/Kohn-Sham (CPHF/KS) approach and full advantage is taken of internal guesses of perturbed and unperturbed density matrices from previous iterations to achieve high compu- tational eﬃciency. A schematic representation of the fully-automated algorithm for the determination of the op- timal Fock exchange of self-consistent hybrid functionals is reported in Figure 4.1, as imple- mented into Crystal17. The procedure starts with a guess for the exact exchange fraction α (any value in the range from 0 to 1) and with the choice of the adopted exchange-correlation DFT functional. At each iteration n of the procedure, the static electronic dielectric tensor of the system is computed, from which an average dielectric constant ϵ(n) ∞is evaluated. At the end of each iteration n, the Fock exchange fraction is updated according to α = 1/ϵ(n) ∞and convergence of the whole process is checked on the average dielectric constant (i.e. convergence is reached when ϵ∞changes by less than 0.1% between two subsequent iterations). The optimal fraction of exact exchange is self-consistently determined by performing a pre- liminary calculation activated by the keyword SCHYBRID, to be inserted at the end of the geometry input block.

The generation of grid points in CRYSTAL is based on an atomic partition method, originally developed by Becke [16] for molecular systems and then extended to periodic systems [273]. Each atomic grid consists of a radial and an angular distribution of points. Grid points are generated through a radial and an angular formula: Gauss-Legendre radial quadrature and Lebedev two-dimensional angular point distribution are used. Lebedev angular grids are classiﬁed according to progressive accuracy levels, as given in the following table: LEV CR98 ℓNang LEV CR98 ℓNang 1 1 9 38 16 53 974 2 2 11 50 17 59 1202 3 13 74 * 18 65 1454 4 15 86 19 71 1730 5 3 17 110 20 77 2030 6 19 146 21 83 2354 7 21 170 22 89 2702 8 4 23 194 23 95 3074 9 25 230 * 24 101 3470 10 5 27 266 * 25 107 389 11 6 29 302 26 113 4334 12 31 350 27 119 4802 13 7 35 434 28 125 5294 14 41 590 29 131 5810 15 47 770 Index of Lebedev accuracy levels LEV: Lebedev accuracy level CR98: corresponding index in CRYSTAL98 ℓ: maximum quantum number of spher- ical harmonics used in Lebedev derivation Nang: number of angular points generated per radial point ∗: sets with negative weights, to be avoided If one Lebedev accuracy level is associated with the whole radial range, the atomic grid is called unpruned, or uniform. In order to reduce the grid size and maintain its eﬀectiveness, the atomic grids of spherical shape can be partitioned into shells, each associated with a diﬀerent angular grid. This procedure, called grid pruning, is based on the assumption that core electron density is usually almost spherically symmetric, and surface to be sampled is small. Also, points far from the nuclei need lower point density, as associated with relatively small weights, so that more accurate angular grids are mostly needed within the valence region than out of it. The choice of a suitable grid is crucial both for numerical accuracy and need of computer resources. Diﬀerent formulae have been proposed for the deﬁnition of grid point weights.

RADSAFE • ∗RAD for developers only [default 2] BATCHPNT • ∗BATCH average number of points in a batch for numerical integration [default 100] In CRYSTAL (serial and parallel versions), in the calculation of the exchange-correlation con- tribution to the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian matrix elements and energy gradients, a grid of NPOINT points is partitioned into batches of points as suggested by Ahlrichs [274]. The unit cell volume is then divided into a number of equivalent sub-volumes which approximates the following ratio: NPOINT/BATCH. Each grid point is assigned to a sub-volume and the set of points inside a sub-volume forms a batch. Since the distribution of grid points is not uniform in the unit cell (it is an atomic grid) the population of batches may vary from a few points to a few thousands. For this reason BATCH does not correspond to the maximum number of points in a batch. For example, batches of grid points close to the nuclei contain many more points than batches in internuclear regions. This may produce load unbalancing in parallel calculations (see CHUNKS). The number of sub-volumes into which subdivided rhe unit cell is altered by changing BATCH. Reducing BATCH may result in some degree of ineﬃciency (minimum value: 1). Changing the value of BATCH can also aﬀect results at some extent if TOLDENS is not suﬃciently accurate, as the selection of contributions to the total density at a point can be inﬂuenced by the deﬁnition of the sub-volumes. Default value of BATCH is 100, as averagely good balance between accuracy and eﬃciency.

CHUNKS allows user to set the maximum number of points per batch so improving load balancing. Recommended value of NCHU: 200. CHUNKS is not implemented under DISTGRID.

These ef- fects lead to the omnipresent attractive London dispersion interaction (also known as attractive part of the van der Waals force). Though considered as a relatively ’weak’ London dispersion interactions play a major role in all organic (organo-metallic) systems and inﬂuence the geom- etry, noncovalent binding energy (lattice energy), frequencies, and even reactivities, i.e. the whole potential energy surface. Thus, for these systems it is crucial to include this interac- tion. Diﬀerent correction schemes are described and compared in Ref. [130]. In CRYSTAL, the D3 London dispersion correction, which has been mainly developed in the group of Prof. Grimme, is implemented including three-body dispersion contributions with fast analytical gradients.[126] Due to restrictions in the computational resources, small atomic orbital basis set expansions are widely used. As the set of orbitals is neither complete nor independent of the geometry, artiﬁcial interactions occur, typically referred to as basis set superposition error. A critical analysis of the error sources and its’ implications is given in Ref. [265]. Apart from the standard Boys-Bernardi couterpoise correction (see keywords GHOSTS and MOLEB- SSE), a semi-empirical geometric counterpoise correction (gCP) has been implemented in CRYSTAL.[161] 3c composite methods While both dispersion and counterpoise corrections can be applied independently, e.g. with a B3LYP-D3-gCP/6-31G* calculation, the performance is best when the parametrization is done together and basis set incompletenesses errors are simultaneously treated by an additional semi- classical correction or by compensating them with an adjusted exchange-correlation functional. These ’composite’ methods are implemented in CRYSTAL and described below, namely: a minimal basis set HF with corrections (HF-3c)[266], a hybrid density functional evaluated in small double-ζ type orbitals with dispersion and counterpoise correction (PBEh-3c)[127], a screened exchange variant of PBEh-3c, dubbed HSE-3c, speciﬁcally designed to be numerically robust for molecular solids,[35] and a pure GGA functional based on the B97 XC functional evaluated in medium sized triple-ζ type orbitals with dispersion and short-range correction (B97-3c)[128]. The following schemes have been carefully tested for molecular dimers, larger molecular assemblies, host-guest-complexes, and molecular crystals. Note that studies on inorganic crystals and metals are less well tested and should be treated carefully. In particular when using a triple-ζ basis set.

These revised methods have been tagged with a label “sol” (as for “solids”) to distinguish them from the original ones proposed for molecules and molecular crystals, they share the same semi-classical corrections exploited by the ”3c” Grimme’s meth- ods (D3, gGP and SRB). The main guidelines adopted during the revision strategy can be summarized ad follows: i employ exchange-correlation functionals developed for solids (i.e. PBEsol and HSEsol) ii reduce the amount of HF exchange in DFT hybrid methods for a better description of electronic properties (e.g. 20-25%) iii apply a simple recipe to make molecular basis sets suitable for inorganic solids The resulting methods have been denoted as HFsol-3c, PBEsol0-3c and HSEsol-3c; detailed input examples can be found in the subsections below. 5.1 DFT-D3 - C6 based London dispersion correction For a range of common density functionals, the D3 correction can be invoked by simply speci- fying the XC functional with the suﬃx ’-D3’ in the DFT input block by means of stand-alone keywords. Here an example follows for the common B3LYP functional. ... DFT B3LYP-D3 END ... By default, the D3 correction includes a damped (BJ damping) atom-atom pairwise term (no three-body term) to the KS-DFT energies (and atomic and cell gradients) (see below for details).[126] Note that not all functionals available in CRYSTAL have been parametrized. A list of available D3 dispersion corrected DFT methods follows: BLYP, PBE, B97, B3LYP, PBE0, PW1PW, M06, HSE06, HSEsol, LC-wPBE. For other XC functionals, parameters must be provided in input (see below) Additionally, the keyword DFTD3, inserted in the third input block and closed by END, allows users to include the three-body term, modify/specify all free method parameters, change the damping function and other options as detailed in the following. D3 correction The D3 augmented KS-DFT energies are obtained as EDFT-D3 = EKS-DFT + Edisp (5.1) with Edisp being the sum of the two- and three-body contributions to the dispersion energy: Edisp = E(2) + E(3) (5.2) = −1 2 X n=6,8 atoms X A,B sn CAB n Rn AB · f d n(RAB) −1 6 atoms X A,B,C CABC 9 R 9 ABC · f d 9 (RABC, θABC).

While the series should in principle incorporate higher orders, they were shown to be of less importance for many systems.[130] In order to match the long- and midrange correlation of D3 with the semilocal correlation computed by the functional, an adequate damping function f d n must be included. CAB n denotes the averaged (isotropic) nth-order dispersion coeﬃcient for atom pair AB, and RAB is their internuclear distance. sn is a functional-dependent scaling factor (see below). In contrast to the D2 method, here the CAB 6 coeﬃcients are estimated from ﬁrst principles by TD-DFT computation of the dynamical polarizability α for model hydrides of all elements and using the Casimir-Polder integration CAB 6 = −3 π Z dω αA(iω)αB(iω) (5.4) These reference C6 are then mapped to the real system via a geometric coordination number. Damping functions In order to avoid near singularities for small distances (RAB), the dispersion contribution needs to be damped at short distances. One possible way is to use rational Becke-Johnson damping as proposed by Becke and Johnson [20, 155, 156], which is the recommended option for the two-body contributions as it avoids artiﬁcial repulsive forces: f d n=6,8(RAB) = Rn AB Rn AB + f(RAB 0 )n (5.5) with[156] RAB 0 = s CAB 8 CAB 6 (5.6) and f(RAB 0 ) = a1RAB 0 + a2. (5.7) In the literature this is typically used as D3(BJ). Damping the dispersion contribution to zero for short ranges (as in Ref.[126]) is also possible: f d n=6,8 = 1 1 + 6(RAB/(sr,nRAB 0 ))−αn . (5.8) Note that the RAB 0 used with this damping are from Ref.[126], the scheme is typically abbreviated as D3(0). For more information on the supported damping functions, see Ref [129]. The Axildor-Teller-Muto type three-body term is used in the following form: f d 9 = (3 cos θa cos θb cos θc + 1) × 1 1 + 6(RABC/(sr,nR ABC 0 ))−αn . (5.9) where θa, θb and θc are the internal angles of the triangle formed by RAB, RBC and RCA, RABC is the geometric mean of RAB, RBC and RAB. The C9 coeﬃcient is approximated by: CABC 9 ≈− q CAB 6 CAC 6 CBC 6 . (5.10) The damping function is similar to the zero damping and has not been revised. Inclusion of the three-body term is often denoted by D3atm.

(5.18) In close correspondence to PBEh-3c, this composite method is based on the modiﬁed double-ζ basis set def2-mSVP, which should be always used when performing HSE-3c calculations.[127]. The Henderson-Janesko-Scuseria (HJS) exchange hole model[269, 85] has been parametrized to closely reproduce the PBEh-3c exchange enhancement factor. The correlation enhancement is kept ﬁxed, the short-range HF exchange is a = 0.42, and the standard error function separation (controlled via the parameter ω = 0.11)[2] switches the HSE-3c potential to a pure generalized gradient approximation (GGA) at long-range. Note that the HSE-3c method has been carefully tested for molecular crystals. Applications to inorganic crystals and metals are less well tested and should be treated carefully. 160'},\n"," {'page_number': 160,\n","  'page_char_count': 2492,\n","  'page_word_count': 385,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 18,\n","  'page_token_count': 623.0,\n","  'text': 'The keyword HSE-3c automatically switches on all needed correction schemes with proper parameter setup.

The basis set development and explicit deﬁnition is given in Ref [128]. The B97 type correlation and exchange enhancement factors have been optimized to absorb certain incompleteness errors of the still not converged basis set. Due to the rather large basis set and the ﬂexible exchange-correlation form most basis set errors can be absorbed into the functional parametrization. Thus, the semi-empirical gCP scheme is not needed. However, all bond-length are systematically too long, which actually holds for all GGA functionals. To correct this, the SRB atom-pair correction (see section 5.3.1) has been adopted. Note that the B97-3c method has been carefully tested for molecular crystals.

Such corrections become increasingly important moving down the periodic table, to heavier elements, in which the eﬀective velocity of the electrons becomes non-negligeable when compared to the speed of light. They can be classiﬁed into two categories, depending on whether or not they are described through scalar operators in the Hamiltonian. The ﬁrst category comprises of scalar-relativistic (SR) eﬀects, and the second is here loosely referred to as spin-orbit coupling (SOC) eﬀects. The reformulation of the (one-component) Schr¨ odinger equation that is consistent with the postulates of special relativity is the four-component Dirac equation. In the Dirac equation, a crystalline orbital (CO) is a 4 × 1 vector function (a four-component “spinor”), rather than a 1 × 1 scalar function ψSchr¨ od k (r) of space (a one-component, 1c, spinor), as well as the electron quasi-momentum k (i.e. the sampling point in the ﬁrst-Brillouin zone, FBZ). More explicitly, a Schr¨ odinger CO ket reads: |ψk⟩= Z dr ψSchr¨ od k (r) |r⟩ (6.1) while a Dirac ket is decomposed as: |ψk⟩= Z dr X σ=↑,↓ X a=L,S ψDirac σ,a,k (r) |r, σ, a⟩ (6.2) in which σ is a spin index and a denotes the so-called “large” and “small” components of the Dirac wavefunction, principally related to positive (electronic) and negative (positronic) energy solutions of the Dirac equation, respectively. In quantum chemistry and materials physics, interest is dominated by the electronic solution of the Dirac equation. It is therefore common practice to write |ψk⟩in a basis of two-component (2c, or Pauli) spinors: |ψk⟩= Z dr X σ=↑,↓ ψPauli σ,k (r) |r, σ⟩ (6.3) ψPauli σ,k (r) are components of the 2 × 1 vector CO ψPauli k (r): ψPauli k (r) = \\x12ψPauli ↑,k (r) ψPauli ↓,k (r) \\x13 (6.4) Comparing Eq.

Such a 2c-SCF strategy has recently been implemented in the Crystal code [62, 63, 65, 64, 66]. In matrix form, Eq.

Such non-interacting atomic densities are calculated using a multiconﬁgurational Hartree-Fock approach described in Ref. [53]. The electronic conﬁguration, including the total spin (or magnetization) on each atomic center is fully determined by the shell occupation numbers entered in the basis set input (see p. 25). By default, the magnetization is oriented along the z-axis. A distinct atomic guess is calculated for each distinct basis set (i.e. typically each distinct chemical element) provided in the basis set input section. A diﬀerent atomic guess on atoms with the same atomic number requires using the keyword CHEMOD (see p. 80). The present keyword (GUESSPATNC, i.e. Guess “P” atomic non-collinear) allows to modify the above described atomic guess by allowing for a magnetization that is oriented along a selected direction (instead of only the z-axis) on diﬀerent atomic centers. The record NB speciﬁes the number of distinct atoms for which the magnetization is modiﬁed. LA contains the label of an atom whose electronic conﬁguration is to be modiﬁed.

PRTENESOC - Detailed printing of energy contributions at each cycle of the 2c-SCF This option provides a detailed printing of contributions to the total energy at each cycle of the self-consistent ﬁeld procedure. Strictly speaking, such individual energy contributions have no physical meaning, but may be useful for numerical analysis.

This is because the inclusion of a SOC operator in the 2c-SCF changes the density matrix, which, in turn, also changes all other individual energy contributions. Please note that the only way to obtain the SOC contribution to the total energy is to perform two calculations, one with the keyword SOC and one without the keyword SOC. SOC - Include spin-orbit coupling in the Hamiltonian. For a calculation with SOC, a SOREP operator must be provided as part of an eﬀective core potential (ECP), either through internal libraries (e.g. the STUTSC, STUTLC, STUTSH, COLUSC, COLULC, COLUSH internal libraries of ECPs), or through manual input of the ECP, using the keyword INPSOC (see section 3.2) SPINORLOCK - Fix number of occupied spinors for a preset number of cycles 175'},\n"," {'page_number': 175,\n","  'page_char_count': 2801,\n","  'page_word_count': 480,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 24,\n","  'page_token_count': 700.25,\n","  'text': 'rec variable meaning • * NSPIN number of occupied spinors • * NCYC number of cycles the locking is maintained Lock the number of occupied spinors to NSPIN for a preset number of cycles NCYC. This option can be used, for instance, to lock the number of occupied bands as being equal to the number of electrons in the unit cell, so as to avoid passing through a metallic state for the ﬁrst NCYC cycles of the 2c-SCF procedure. This keyword is similar to SPINLOCK used in the 1c-SCF (see p. 129). However, unlike in the 1c-SCF, it is not possible to deﬁne a number of occupied spin-up or spin-down bands, because spin is no longer a good quantum number to label the states in the 2c-SCF. Thus, rather than locking the number of up- or down- levels (as in SPINLOCK), this keyword simply locks the number of total levels. 6.3 Non-Collinear Density Functional Theory For studying open-shell molecules and materials, it is nowadays common practice to employ the spin-DFT [281]. In this theory, the exchange-correlation energy functional is allowed to depend on the electron density ρ, as well as the spin or magnetization vector m = [mx, my, mz]. Usually the magnetization is quantized along the z direction (i.e. the “collinear” approach) and the functional then reads Exc = Exc [ρ, mz]. We also note that using the spin densities ρ↑and ρ↓, as well as the relations ρ = ρ↑+ ρ↓and mz = ρ↑−ρ↓, allows to write this same functional as Exc = Exc \\x02 ρ↑, ρ↓\\x03 . The limitation for the functional to depend on only one Cartesian component of the magne- tization is insuﬃcient if the electronic state can be described by a Hamiltonian including an electron-electron ee interaction that depends explicitly on spin. This is the case of the so- called geometrically frustrated states of matter, occuring for instance, in face-centered cubic Fe, as well as certain Jarosite and Garnet minerals that exhibit the “Kagom´ e” lattice, with nearest neighbours in a triangular arrangement. But perhaps a more important example is for an open-shell system with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In such cases, (ee interaction depending on spin), the total energy obtained from a Exc = Exc [ρ, mz] collinear calculation becomes dependent on the arbitrary orientation in space of the system w.r.t. the Cartesian frame. It is then clearly necessary to use instead an exchange-correlation energy formula like Exc = Exc [ρ, mx, my, mz], to restore rotational invariance of the total energy. This is the idea of the non-collinear (NC) DFT approach. In CRYSTAL, the NC-DFT approach is useable for a calculation in the two-component spinor basis (see section 6.2). It may be activated by using one of two keywords NONCOLC or NONCOLSF, as in the following two examples: ... 99 0 END ... TWOCOMPON END ...

The Journal of Chemical Physics, 154(20), 204110.” In spin-DFT, the exchange-correlation potential has the general form:[281] ˆ V = δEDFA δρ ˆ σ0 + X a=x,y,z δEDFA δma ˆ σa (6.15) where ˆ σ0 is a 2 × 2 unit matrix and ˆ σa are the 2 × 2 Pauli matrices. This expression is simpliﬁed in the collinear approach: ˆ V ≡ˆ V col = δEDFA δρ ˆ σ0 + δEDFA δmz ˆ σz (6.16) where ˆ V col is block diagonal, that is to say ˆ V σσ′ = δσσ′ ˆ V σσ. In the LDA:[66] ˆ V σσ = ∂εLDA ∂ρσ (6.17) in which εLDA is the LDA energy-density, ρ↑= 1 2 (ρ + mz) and ρ↓= 1 2 (ρ −mz). In the GGA, it turns out to be convenient to not work directly with ˆ V σσ, but rather with its matrix elements V σσ µν (g) in an AO basis, which read:[66] V σσ µν (g) = Z ∂εGGA ∂ρσ ϱg µνdr + Z h 2 ∂εGGA ∂|∇ρσ|2 ∇ρσ + ∂εGGA ∂γcol +− ∇ρσ′i · ∇ϱg µνdr (6.18) where σ ̸= σ′ and the overlap distribution ϱg µν reads: ϱg µν (r) = χµ (r −aµ) χν (r −g −aν) (6.19) and χν is an AO centered at aν in cell g.

By default a full geometry optimization (atomic positions and cell) is performed. This was not the case with previous versions of the program, where atomic posi- tions only were optimized by default. Users can ﬁnd supplementary information and input examples in the CRYSTAL Tutorials Project web page at the CRYSTAL web site (http://www.crystal.unito.it/tutorials). 7.1 Geometry optimization strategy A Quasi-Newton optimization scheme is implemented. Gradients are evaluated every time the total energy is computed; the second derivative matrix (i.e. Hessian matrix) is built from the gradients. The default choice for the initial Hessian matrix is obtained from a model Hessian, as proposed by Schlegel and updated by using the BFGS algorithm[38, 39, 109, 122, 259]. By default the step considered is the Newton step (direction and length) controlled by the Trust Radius scheme (see ALLOWTRUSTR page 193). NOTRUSTR to remove trust radius control (CRYSTAL06 default choice). HF and DFT (pure and hybrid functionals) analytical gradients for atomic positions and cell parameters, are used for insulators and conductors, both for all-electron and ECP calculations. Note that for conducting systems analytic ﬁrst derivatives are not fully implemented when the keyword SMEAR (page 126) is used. In that case, numerical ﬁrst derivatives should be computed (see page 196). For very small value of smearing (around 0.001 hartree) analytical gradients can be used. For atomic positions (ATOMONLY option), geometry optimization is performed in sym- metrized fractional coordinates, in order to exploit the point group symmetry of the lattice. The keyword PRSYMDIR (input block 1, page 69) may be used to print the so-called sym- metry allowed directions adopted in the geometry optimization. If there are no symmetry allowed directions, the program prints a warning message and stops. To optimize the lattice parameters a set of symmetry preserving cell deformations (see Symme- try Allowed Elastic Distortions, USESAED, page 78) related to changes of isotropic volume and of axial ratios is deﬁned. By default, the symmetry allowed deformations are printed in the output ﬁle. When a full optimization of atom positions and cell parameters is carried out, a conveniently normalized combined set of symmetrized directions and deformations is adopted. Optional choice (keyword INTREDUN, page 197) is the geometry optimization in redundant internal coordinates. In such a case, atomic displacements and cell deformations are implicitly determined by the internal coordinate system. 7.2 Default setting 7.2.1 Type of optimization The default geometry optimization type is the relaxation of both the nuclear coordinates and the lattice parameters. Optional choices: see page 191. 7.2.2 Convergence criteria A stationary point on the potential energy surface is found when the forces acting on atoms are numerically zero. Geometry optimization is usually completed when the gradients are below a given threshold. In crystal, the optimization convergence is checked on the root-mean-square (RMS) and the absolute value of the largest component of both the gradients and the estimated displacements. When these four conditions are all satisﬁed at a time, optimization is considered complete. 188'},\n"," {'page_number': 188,\n","  'page_char_count': 2431,\n","  'page_word_count': 379,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 29,\n","  'page_token_count': 607.75,\n","  'text': 'In some cases (see page. 208), the optimization process stops with a warning message controlled by the threshold in the energy change between consecutive optimization steps.

This ﬁle is suitable to be read by molecular graphics programs (e.g. Molden...) to display the animation of a geometry optimization run. fort.34 If optimization is successful, the last geometry in written in ﬁle fort.34 (format de- scribed in Appendix D, page 451). The ﬁle can be read to deﬁne the basic geometry input. See EXTERNAL, page 21 opta(c)xxx At each xxx optimization step, the geometry is written in ﬁle optaxxx (opti- mization of atoms coordinates only), or optcxxx (optimization of cell parameters or full optimization) in the format of ”fort.34” ﬁle (see Appendix D, page 451). The ﬁle must be renamed ”fort.34” if used to enter geometry input (keyword EXTERNAL). The ”history” of the optimization allows restarting from a given step with diﬀerent parameters, when the procedure did not converge. OPTINFO.DAT contains information to restart optimization. (see keyword RESTART in OPTGEOM input block, page 196).

HESSNUM initial guess: numerical estimate 7.3.3 Tabulated atomic radii The construction of the set of internal coordinates which is used in the deﬁnition of the Schlegel model Hessian relies on tabulated values for the atomic radii, according to which bonds, angles and dihedrals are deﬁned. Two diﬀerent tables can be choosen in input with the following keywords: COVRAD The covalent radii table is used in the construction of the internal coor- dinates. This is the default choice, which is reasonable in most cases but may lead to a ill deﬁned Schlegel model Hessian in some compact ionic structures.

Trust Radius [default] A more sophisticated and accurate technique to control the step size is the trust radius region scheme. The trust radius limits the step length of the displacement at each cycle, according to the quadratic form of the surface in the actual region. The default maximum value for minimization is 0.5.

A three-point numerical derivative formula is adopted. A ﬁnite positive (and then negative) displacement is applied to the desired coordinate and a full SCF calculation is performed. The gradient is then computed as gi = E∆xi −E−∆xi 2 ∆xi where ∆xi is the ﬁnite displacement along the i-coordinate. Such a computation is very expensive compared to analytical gradients, since the cost is 2·N ·t, where N is the number of coordinates to be optimized and t the cost of the SCF calculation.

Optional keywords related to geometry optimization in redundant internal coordinates must follow. A symmetrized set of internal coordinates (i.e. bonds, angles and torsions) is automatically deﬁned, which contains much more coordinates than the requisite internal degrees of freedom. Redundant internal coordinates are generated according to a hierarchical scheme: bond lengths are ﬁrstly identiﬁed by using covalent radii. Then, angles are determined on the basis of the irreducible set of distances and, ﬁnally, dihedral angles are deﬁned. Note that to deﬁne bonds the sum of covalent radii (see page 69) is used. For ionic systems the default values can be automatically set by using the IONRAD directive (see pag. 192), or explicitly setting them with the RAYCOV keyword (page 69). In case of systems constituted by unconnected fragments (ie some molecular crystals or adsorption complexes), fragments are automatically linked to each other by pseudo “bond lengths” between the closest pair of atoms belonging to each fragment. There has been substantial controversy in recent years concerning the optimal coordinate system for optimizations. For molecular systems, it is now well-established that redundant internal coordinates require fewer optimization steps than Cartesian coordinates. However, this is not deﬁnitely demonstrated for periodic systems. Nevertheless, the use of internal coordinates can be very useful in several respects: for a chemical intuitive view (e.g. internal 197'},\n"," {'page_number': 197,\n","  'page_char_count': 3211,\n","  'page_word_count': 481,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 27,\n","  'page_token_count': 802.75,\n","  'text': 'coordinates can easily be added), for constrained geometry optimization (see below) and for searching transition states. By default, optimization of internal redundant coordinates involves both atomic positions and cell parameters. To avoid optimizing cell parameters the keyword FIXCELL page 201 must be speciﬁed. Before running a geometry optimization in redundant internal coordinates, the set of coordi- nates generated automatically by CRYSTAL should be checked for consistency. This can be done by specifying the keyword TESTREDU. Optional keywords related to the geometry optimization in redundant internal coordinates are listed below. INTLMIXED geometry optimization in selected valence internal mixed with or embed- ded in a full set of general symmetrized fractional and cell parameters The optimization is performed in a mixed coordinate system made up of a set of selected valence internal parameters (bond length, angles and dihedrals) and the full set of symmetry adapted fractional displacements and elastic distortions. As in the previous case, the coordinate system is redundant but the number of parameters generated is in general substantially smaller than in the case of INTREDUN. Therefore, it is convenient for calculations with a large number of atoms in which the automatic generation of valence internal parameters makes the dimension of the optimization parameters space huge. It is also useful when the lack of connectivity of the system causes quasi-linear dependencies reﬂected in a very high condition number of the Wilson B-Matrix. The latter fact usually makes the optimization either to fail or to exhibit an erratic behavior. It is recommended in transition state optimizations of large systems, in particular when freezing selected valence parameters, SCANREDU, or PATHFOLLOW/FITTOPATH options. This option does not generate automatically valence internal coordinates unless the user explicitly indicate atomic connections through keywords DEFLNGS and DEFANGLS. The tree is automatically completed generating the necessary lengths, angles or dihedrals. For the back-transformation to the non-redundant set, the BKTRNSF2 algorithm is considered. This option is not compatible with DBANGLIST, page 199. Managing with almost linear angles Linear or almost linear angles (i.e. close to 180◦) can lead to numerical instabilities in the computation of the dihedrals. To avoid this problem a common practice is to split the angle in two ones. Double angles are deﬁned as a couple of angles obtained by projection of the vectors onto two suitable perpendicular planes. This avoids the indetermination around 180◦. The threshold value, beyond which the almost linear angle is split, is controlled by the keyword ANGTODOUBLE. ANGTODOUBLE minimum value (degrees) beyond which a double angle is deﬁned • ∗AL value of the angle (degrees) - default [165◦] The default value is set to 165◦. This means that all angles larger than 165◦are automatically split into two. This option can be required, for instance, when optimizing zeolitic structures where siloxane bridges could change a lot during the geometry minimization. In that case, it is better to reduce the default value to 150◦. 198'},\n"," {'page_number': 198,\n","  'page_char_count': 2520,\n","  'page_word_count': 445,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 18,\n","  'page_token_count': 630.0,\n","  'text': 'A list of angles to be converted into two can also be explicitly given by specifying DBANGLIST list of angles chosen to be converted in double angles - advanced option • ∗MU number of angles to convert in double • ∗(IN(I), I=1,MU) list of the angles This keyword provides the list of angles chosen to be converted in double angles (i.e. deﬁned by the angles obtained by projection of the vectors onto two suitable perpendicular planes) in order to avoid the indetermination around 180 degrees). This option is not compatible with INTLMIXED, page 198 . The labels used for the angles are those provided by a previous automatic generation of internal coordinates computed in a test run (TESTREDU keyword). Double angles have to be deﬁned at the starting of the optimization. If any single angle ap- proaches 180◦the program stops with a message. For this reason, it is strongly recommended foresee before the optimization which are the angles that may evolve to close to 180◦degree and protect them making them explicitly double. A less recommendable alternative is to set an ANGTODOUBLE value very small (< 90◦) so as to make double any eventual tricky angle. Such a procedure requires less eﬀort to the user but must be used with caution as the number of angles and dihedrals based on them may explode. Explicitly deﬁning internal coordinates - bonds and angles When some relevant internal coordinates are missing (e.g. intermolecular bonds) they can be explicitly deﬁned by means of two keywords: DEFLNGS and DEFANGLS. DEFLNGS deﬁnition of bond lengths • ∗NL number of bonds to be added insert NL sets of 5 data to deﬁne the bond AB II LA label of the atom A (it must be in the reference cell) LB label of the atom B I1, I2, I3 indices of the cell where the atom B is located DEFANGLS deﬁnition of bond angles • ∗NL number of angles to be deﬁned insert NL sets of 9 data to deﬁne the angle \\\\ ABC II LA label of the atom A (it must be in the reference cell) LB label of the atom B I1, I2, I3 indices of the cell where the atom B is located LC label of the atom C I1, I2, I3 indices of the cell where the atom C is located Choosing method for back-transformation By default CRYSTAL employs an iterative method (P. Pulay and G. Fogarasi, “Geometry optimization in redundant internal coordinates”, J. Chem. Phys. 96, 2856 (1992)) so as to compute the atomic positions and cell parameters corresponding to the set of redundant internal coordinates obtained at each optimization point. For those periodic systems in which 199'},\n"," {'page_number': 199,\n","  'page_char_count': 3270,\n","  'page_word_count': 514,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 19,\n","  'page_token_count': 817.5,\n","  'text': 'the generated internal coordinates have a high degree of redundancy and/or the displacement is relatively large (for instance in the starting points of the optimization when geometry is very far from the target one) such a method may fail for large steps and provide inaccurate displacements making the whole optimization less eﬃcient. As an alternative you might change the strategy for back-transformation using the keyword BKTRNSF2 Under such an option, the program performs back-transformations from redundant (internal) to fractional+cell coordinate systems through an alternative procedure based on the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. The idea of the method is as follows. Given a reference set of redundant parameters, the best point in terms of atomic positions and lattice parameters is the one that is the closest as possible to the reference one in the redundant parameter space. The distance function is deﬁned as a weighted mean square of the diﬀerences betwen redundant parameters of the trial and reference sets. This function is fastly minimized by the CG strategy. The main drawback is that the new method is slightly more costly in cpu time and memory space than the default iterative one. In all tests done, this new scheme for the back-transformation works better than the iterative procedure originally proposed by Pulay for molecules and extended in Crystal to periodic systems: 1. It is safer in its convergence; specially when the displacement step in terms of redundant coordinates is very large and the structure displays a large number of connectivity loops (this happens in most natural crystals). In such cases the ”old” method fails and the program performs a rough conversion that is often very poor in accuracy. 2. As concerns the optimization process, the use of this more accurate alterative allows in most cases to save a few points leading to an overall gain in computational time, even if the conjugate gradient scheme is a bit more costly than the simple iterative procedure. An additional advantage of the algorithm is that it allows to set weights to the squared devi- ations of the redundant parameters used in the deviation function so as to force some of them to be better approched than the others in the back-transformation procedure. This permits a more controlled deﬁnition of the steps in terms of internal redundant coordinates. The choice is optative in the MODINTCOOR option, and during the optimization it can be set by means of the keyword WGHTDREDU. WGHTDREDU Assign weights for back-transformation • ∗NMODI Number of internal coordinates to be given an speciﬁc weight DEFWGTH Default weight for internal coordinates not explicitly deﬁned • ∗NRED(I), WEIGHT(I), I=1,NMODI Label of coordinate (in the list of internal redundants coordinates pro- duced in output with directive TESTREDU) and speciﬁc weight. Speciﬁc weights may be used to provide priorities when diﬀerent internal coordinates are in conﬂict in the back-transformation, as the corresponding redundant set of values does not correspond to any real atomic arrangement. This typically occurs for instance when the con- nectivity graph exhibits a high degree of nested loops.

On the other hand, option E is only operative together with the choice of a redundant internal coordinate system (INTRE- DUN page 197). The examples in the CRYSTAL Tutorial Project web page illustrate the use of the available keywords for constrained geometry optimizations. A - Constant volume optimization CVOLOPT constant volume optimization. Only active with CELLONLY (cell parameters only optimization), FULLOPTG (atom coordinates and cell parameters optimization) or INTREDUN (redundant coordinates optimization). The volume is kept ﬁxed at the value corresponding to the input unit cell; all cell angles and ratios between cell edges unconstrained by the point-group symmetry are optimized. Examples: in the tetragonal symmetry, only the c/a ratio, and in the monoclinic symmetry the a/b and b/c ratios and the beta angle, respectively, are optimized. This option is useful for computing E vs V curves point-by-point by relaxing the crystalline structure at diﬀerent values of the cell volume. In this case, the keyword FIXINDEX must be used to obtain a smooth curve. The reference geometry must correspond either to the smallest volume to be explored, or to the equilibrium structure obtained from a prior optimization run (FULLOPTG). Warning: if large changes of the individual unit-cell parameters occur in the optimization process, the linear strain approximation may not be strictly obeyed and very small volume variations (of the order of 0.01%) may ensue.

The symmetrized forces are then computed by using the new set of symmetrized coordinates. See example in section 16.4, page 385. E - Fixing internal coordinates Constraints on internal coordinates can be easily imposed during geometry optimization.

For instance, one can keep ﬁxed a bond angle together with the constraint that the x and y fractional coordinates of a given atom change by the same amount. Such a combination of constraining strategies must be used with caution, as it may lead to undesired behavior in the optimization process. The constraining of internal coordinates is performed with numerical techniques (particularly in the back-transformation from redundant internal to cell/atomic coordinate systems) and the ﬁxed values may be aﬀected by some small changes (in general of the order of 10−4 au).

With default thresholds, diﬀerent selection of integrals are evaluated with diﬀerent geometries. This introduces small discontinuities in the PES, producing artiﬁcial noise in the optimization process. To avoid noise in interpolation of PES, the FIXINDEX option is always active during optimization. The adopted selection pattern refers to the starting geometry. If equilibrium geometry is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the starting point, reference truncation pattern may be inappropriate and the use of proper truncation becomes mandatory. Since both total energy and gradients are aﬀected by the integrals classiﬁcation, a single-point energy calculation ought to be run always with the ﬁnal structure, and integrals classiﬁed according to the new ﬁnal geometry, to calculate correct total energy and gradients. If during the ﬁnal run the convergence test on the forces is not satisﬁed, optimization has to be restarted, keeping the integrals classiﬁcation based on the new geometry. The FINALRUN option has been implemented to this aim. The four diﬀerent options of FINALRUN allow the following actions, after classiﬁcation of integrals: 1. single-point energy calculation (correct total energy), 2. single-point energy and gradient calculation (correct total energy and gradients), 3. single-point energy and gradient computation, followed by a new optimization process, starting from the ﬁnal geometry of the previous one, (used to classify the integrals), if the convergence test is not satisﬁed. 4. step 3 is iterated until full stable optimization If the starting and ﬁnal geometry are close, the energy and gradient calculated from the ﬁnal geometry, with integral classiﬁcation based on the initial geometry, are not very diﬀerent from the values obtained with correct classiﬁcation of integrals. In some cases (e.g. optimization of 207'},\n"," {'page_number': 207,\n","  'page_char_count': 2635,\n","  'page_word_count': 419,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 23,\n","  'page_token_count': 658.75,\n","  'text': 'the geometry of a surface, with reconstruction) the two geometries are very diﬀerent, and a second optimization cycle is almost mandatory (ICODE=4 in FINALRUN input). This is the default in crystal. 7.4.2 Optimization of ﬂat surfaces Flat regions of surfaces often behave as non quadratic. This may give rise to erratic opti- mization paths when using the linear minimization to control the step length. In these cases it is recommendable using the trust radius strategy set by the keyword ALLOWTRUSTR. Under this scheme the step is controlled so as to never go out from the quadratically behaved regions of the surface (the trust regions). Additionally, one can set the maximum trust radius to a given value MAXTRADIUS [def ∞], in order to avoid too large displacements from one point to the next one. Additional combined test on gradient and energy are adopted for treating special cases: 1. If the gradient criteria are satisﬁed (but not the displacement criteria) and the energy diﬀerence between two steps is below a given threshold (see TOLDEE), the optimization stops with a warning message; 2. If both the gradient and displacements criteria are not satisﬁed, but the energy does not change (TOLDEE parameter) for four subsequent steps, the optimization stops with a warning message. 7.4.3 Restart optimization Restart of geometry optimization is possible for a job which is abruptly terminated (e.g. number of steps exceeded, available cpu time exceeded,...). The optimization restarts from the last complete step of the previous run. The geometry at each step is written to ﬁle optc number of step, and can be read by EXTER- NAL (see page 21). If optimization ended successfully, the optimized geometry is written to ﬁle fort.34 (EXTER- NAL format). When restarting an optimization, information on previous optimization steps is read from ﬁle OPTINFO.DAT. Optimization then proceeds, saving information in the same ﬁle at each step.

An example of transition state search is presented in http://www.crystal.unito.it/tutorials By default the eigenvector that corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue is followed uphill according to the scheme proposed by Simmons and Nichols [Simmons, J., and Nichols, J.: , Int. J. Quantum Chem. Symp. 24, volume 24, 263, (1990)]. To adopt other choices for directions to be followed uphill see keywords: MODEFOLLOW, PATHFOLLOW, FITTOPATH and CHNGTSFOL. 7.5.1 Transition state control keywords MODEFOLLOW • ∗MODEFOL mode to follow ABS(MODEFOL) is the label of the eigenvector to be followed uphill initially, namely DIR(0). If MODEFOL < 0, the initial uphill direction, DIR(0), is the opposite to that of the eigenvector of label ABS(MODEFOL) In a general optimization step, NSTEP, the current uphill direction DIR(NSTEP) is chosen as the hessian eigenvector of maximum overlap with the direction chosen in the previous step, DIR(NSTEP-1). In this scheme the uphill direction is allowed to smoothly change along the optimization. Some problems might appear when there are quasi-degeneracies between the Hessian eigenvalue of the uphill direction and other that corresponds to a direction to be fol- lowed downhill. In such a case the optimization might go in troubles. Using PATHFOLLOW is a safer way to deﬁne the uphill direction and so the reaction path. PATHFOLLOW only with redundant internal coords • ∗NPATHFOL max coord to choose the mode to follow Only valid together with INTREDUN/INTLMIXED. The uphill direction is the eigenvector that has maximal absolute contribution of the internal valence coordinate labeled ABS(NPATHFOL), which is thus supposed to dominate the reaction path. If NPATHFOL < 0, the uphill search is such that the value of coordinate ABS(NPATHFOL) decreases along the reaction coordinate, otherwise the opposite direction is chosen. At variance with the MODEFOLLOW case, where the reference direction changes from step to step, here the same strategy is employed in every step of the optimization. This prevents troubles when near-degeneracies occur (see keyword MODEFOLLOW). FITTOPATH only with redundant internal coords • ∗NPATHFOL2 integer NPATHWEIGHT integer Only valid together with INTREDUN/INTLMIXED and PATHFOLLOW ABS(NPATHFOL2) is the label of a second internal valence coordinate, namely coordinate (II), that together with the one labeled ABS(NPATHFOL), coordinate (I), mostly contributes to the reaction coordinate.

Otherwise, the one with maximum contribution having opposite sign is considered. CHNGTSFOL only with redundant internal coords Valid together with INTREDUN/INTLMIXED, PATHFOLLOW (FITTOPATH). The optimization follows uphill the path according to the PATHFOLLOW (+FIT- TOPATH) scheme while the chosen eigenvector is not the ﬁrst one in the list ordered by increasing eigenvalues, i.e. it has not the lowest eigenvalue. Once such a situation reverts, the scheme changes to MODEFOLLOW in the following steps and the uphill direction is chosen according to the criterion of maximum overlap with the previous uphill direction (see MODEFOLLOW keyword). 7.5.2 Scan keywords SCANATOM • ∗NATSCAN (integer): label of the atom to be scanned TARGET (real array dim 3): last position of the atom in the scan MSCAN number of steps in which the previous displacement is carried out Only for P1 structures. Perform a series of optimizations in which one atom is kept ﬁxed at diﬀerent contiguous posi- tions and the remainder of the structure fully or partially relaxed.

The atom chosen for scan and any other one with the only condition that belongs to that part of the system chosen to remain associated to the center of mass, must be deﬁned as ﬁxed with the FRAGMENT option. This directive may be used associated with FRAGSCAN. The keyword has the same syntax as FRAGMENT and deﬁnes a set of atoms that after each step of the scan have the same displacement of the scanned atom, NATSCAN, so as to set the geometry of the starting point of the next optimization of the sequence.

The mass-weighted Hessian matrix is diagonalized to obtain eigenvalues, which are converted in frequencies (cmISOTROPIC−1), and eigenvectors, i.e. the normal modes. 8.1.2 Equilibrium Geometry The ﬁrst step to compute frequencies is the calculation of the wave function at the equilibrium geometry.

Atomic Born tensors are the key quantities for the calculation of the IR intensities, the oscillator strengths, the LO/TO splitting and the static dielectric tensor. Such quantities are written in the external formatted unit BORN.DAT. In order to compute the LO/TO splitting, the high frequency dielectric tensor must be provided. See keyword DIELTENS, page 215. The integrated IR intensity Ip for the p −th mode is computed according to: Ip = π 3 NA c2 · dp · |⃗ Zp|2 (8.4) where NA is the Avogadro’s number, c is the speed of light, dp is the degeneracy of the mode, ⃗ Zp is the mass-weighted eﬀective mode Born charge vector.

This is possible for 3D, 2D, 1D and 0D systems, but only for insulating system.

The scheme operates on the crystalline-orbital eigenfunctions in the reciprocal space. As a consequence of that, the accuracy of IR intensities might be sensitive to the density of the Monkhorst net. There are no additional keywords related to this method. 8.3.2 IR intensities through Wannier functions Calculation of IR intensities through Wannier functions is invoked by the keyword INTLOC following INTENS in FREQCALC input block. Many keywords are related to the Wannier functions calculation that should be used by devel- opers and very experienced users only. If keyword INTLOC is activated in FREQCALC input block, IR intensities, atomic Born tensors and LO/TO splitting are evaluated through the Wannier functions, obtained by local- izing the crystalline orbitals. This is possible for insulators only. IR intensities calculation through localization is very demanding, in terms of memory alloca- tion. NOINTENS, default choice, avoids intensity calculation, when not necessary. As regards the computation of the IR intensities, they are obtained by means of the Wan- nier Function (WF) approach, in which those functions span the occupied manifold and are explicitly constructed in real space. They are at time obtained from the eigenvectors of the one- electron Hamiltonian (Bloch Functions) by numerical integration in reciprocal space through the deﬁnition of a Pack-Monkhorst net. The system must be an insulator. By default the dipole moment in the non central points are computed with Wannier Functions that are the projection onto the occupied space of the current point of those obtained by localization at the central point. If RELOCAL is requested these WFs are relocalized at each point This procedure leads not to real WFs, but to an approximation contained into a cyclic space. In the mapping (unfolding) that permits to convert cyclic to real WFs, CRYSTAL exploits the classiﬁcation of the lattice vectors made at the very beginning of the SCF calculation that, obviously, does not involve the inﬁnite space, but just a cluster of a ﬁnite number of cells, ordered by increasing length (i.e. it covers a close to spherical region of the real space). In all the tested cases, this classiﬁcation provides suﬃcient room to represent the matrices needed in the SCF part within the required accuracy. This is also so in what concerns the (post-SCF) computation of the WFs, apart from very particular cases in which the primitive cell is oblong and the corresponding unfolded cyclic cluster associated to the Monkhorst-Pack net (also very elongated in one direction) does not ﬁt into the real cluster (always close to spherical shape). A set of keywords can be used to modify the localization process (see properties input, keyword LOCALWF, page 332) They are entered after the DIPOMOME keyword. Modiﬁcation of default choices is not recommended, it should be restricted to developers only. The keyword DIPOMOME deﬁnes an input block (closed by END) with keywords allowing modiﬁcation of the localization process.

The real and imaginary parts of ϵ(ν) are computed; the maxima of the latter function correspond to the TO frequencies. The imaginary part of 1/ϵ(ν) is computed as well, whose maxima correspond to the LO frequencies.

To each k-point in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, 3N oscillators (i.e. phonons) are associated which are labeled by a phonon band index i (i = 1, . . . ,3N).

Such an interpolation technique, can be easily activated with the INTERPHESS keyword (to be inserted after DISPERSION) and can be quite eﬀective in the case of a fully covalent crystal without long-range electrostatic contribution to the total energy. On the contrary, when such electrostatic contributions become relevant (as in ionic crystals), they have to be explicitly accounted for with appropriate corrections (see the WANG key- word below). In this case one should use a SC large enough to contain all relevant quantum contributions and the two keywords INTERPHESS and WANG.

From equation (8.26), the PDOS is normalized to 3N, being N the number of atoms per cell ( R g(ω)dω = 3N).

In this section, we present the implemented algorithms and brieﬂy introduce some formal aspects of anharmonic vibrational states of molecules and solids, where, in the case of solids, we restrict our attention to Γ-point vibration modes. However, let us note that, by working in terms of a supercell of the primitive one, vibration modes of solids proper of diﬀerent k-points can be folded back to the Γ-point.

The numerical description of high-order terms of the PES represents the most delicate and computationally expensive step in the anharmonic treatment of vibrational states of materials. In our strategy, the PES is truncated to quartic order and contains one-, two- and three- mode interatomic force constants. Four diﬀerent numerical approaches have been implemented, all based on a grid representation of the PES in the basis of the normal coordinates, that require diﬀerent ingredients (energy and/or forces) to be evaluated at each point (i.e. nuclear conﬁguration) of the grid. Diﬀerent algorithms have been explored to compute the high-order energy derivatives: energy ﬁtting and ﬁnite diﬀerences. The numerical stability and relative computational eﬃciency of the various schemes has been discussed in the references given above. Figure 8.3 provides a graphical representation of the grids used with the four schemes. 239'},\n"," {'page_number': 239,\n","  'page_char_count': 2650,\n","  'page_word_count': 436,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 16,\n","  'page_token_count': 662.5,\n","  'text': 'Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, vibrational states are determined by solving the nuclear Schr¨ odinger equation, which, in terms of normal coordinates, reads: HΨs(Q) = EsΨs(Q) , (8.29) where Ψs(Q) is the vibrational wavefunction of the s-th vibrational state and Es the cor- responding energy. By setting the rotational angular momentum to zero and by neglecting rotational coupling eﬀects, the Hamiltonian operator in Eq. (8.29) can be written as: H = M X i=1 −1 2 ∂2 ∂Q2 i + V (Q) , (8.30) where V (Q) is the usual Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) in the basis of mass-weighted normal coordinates. As discussed above, the description of the potential term in the Hamiltonian is a computationally challenging task. Here, we expand the PES in a Taylor’s series centered at the equilibrium nuclear conﬁguration as follows: V (Q) = 1 2 M X i=1 ω2 i Q2 i + 1 3! M X i,j,k=1 ηijkQiQjQk + + 1 4!

These high-order energy derivatives are computed numerically, which makes the description of the PES a computationally demanding task. For this reason, it proves crucial to devise: i) eﬀective strategies to truncate the expansion of the PES in Eq. (8.31) so as to include only those terms contributing signiﬁcantly to the description of the vibrational states of the system, and ii) eﬃcient algorithms for the numerical evaluation of the high-order energy derivatives in Eqs.

Within a 4T representation, the PES can be further truncated by considering only those force constants involving a maximum of n distinct modes (namely, a nM representation of the potential). By combining the two truncation strategies introduced above, a 1M4T representation of the PES would require the evaluation of these force constants: ηiii, ηiiii ∀i ∈M .

By computing the analytical gradients at some conﬁgurations (only those where atoms are displaced along one normal coordinate at a time), an eﬀective ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme has been devised, which is called EGH from the diﬀerent ingredients it requires: energy, gradients and Hessian. Figure 8.3 3) shows the points needed for each pair of modes (Qi, Qj), where some nuclear conﬁgurations only require the energy to be evaluated while others require energy and gradients. The Hessian matrix is computed just at the equilibrium nuclear conﬁguration to get the harmonic normal modes and frequencies. For each pair of modes, all the terms of the 2M4T representation of the PES in Eq. (8.36) can be obtained from the following ﬁnite diﬀerence relations: ηiii = 1 s2 i \\x00Gi −1 −2Gi 0 + Gi 1 \\x01 (8.38) ηiij = 1 s2 i (Gj −1,0 −2Gj 0,0 + Gj 1,0) (8.39) ηiiii = 3 s3 i \\x00Gi 1 −2siωi −Gi −1 \\x01 (8.40) ηiiij = 3 s3 i (Gj 1,0 −Gj −1,0) (8.41) ηiijj = − 1 2s2 i s2 j (8E0,0 −4E−1,−1 −4E1,1 + −sjGj 0,−1 + sjGj 0,1 −siGi −1,0 + siGi 1,0 + −4sjGj −1,0 + 4sjGj 1,0 −4siGi 0,−1 + 4siGi 0,1 + +2s2 i ωi + 2s2 jωj) , (8.42) where si = h/√ωi and sj = h/√ωj are the adaptive steps among the points of the grid along the Qi and Qj normal coordinates (see the references above for more details on how the step h is deﬁned) and where Ea,b is the energy computed at a nuclear conﬁguration displaced by asiQi + bsjQj from the equilibrium one. For those terms of the PES involving only one mode, a more compact notation is used where Ea is the energy of a nuclear conﬁguration displaced by asiQi from the equilibrium one. Gi a,b is the gradient with respect to Qi computed at a nuclear conﬁguration displaced by asiQi + bsjQj from the equilibrium one (analogously, Gj a,b is the gradient with respect to Qj computed at the same nuclear conﬁguration). For those terms of the PES involving only one mode, a more compact notation is used where Gi a is the gradient with respect to Qi of a nuclear conﬁguration displaced by asiQi from the equilibrium one. Keywords In order to activate the calculation of those cubic and quartic anharmonic terms of the PES discussed above, the ANHAPES keyword has to be used, within the FREQCALC input block. Indeed, ﬁrst harmonic frequencies must be computed in order to get the normal modes of the system, which constitute the starting point of the anharmonic treatment. The keyword ANHAPES allows the user to manually deﬁne the M modes to be considered for the anharmonic treatment. That is, the user can decide to treat anharmonically just a sub-set of the whole set of normal modes of the system. The keyword ANHAPES also allows the user to select which of the four numerical schemes to be used in the evaluation of the PES and to set the step h.

(8.29) numerically. In particular, several methods have been developed to progressively take into account the correlation among vibration modes, through mode-mode couplings, which are formally analogous to the hierarchy of wavefunction-based methods in electronic structure theory. The vibrational analog of the Hartree-Fock (HF) method is known as vibrational self-consistent ﬁeld (VSCF) approach: a mean-ﬁeld scheme where each vibrational degree of freedom interacts with an average potential over the other modes. In analogy to the deﬁnition of dynamical electron correlation, the vibrational correlation among modes is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the exact vibrational states and VSCF ones. In electronic structure theory, the HF solution can be used as a starting point to improve the description of the electronic wave-function, passing from a single-determinantal to a multi-determinantal representation by using either perturbative (MP2, MP4, etc.) or variational (CC, CI, etc.) approaches. In the vibration theory, starting from the reference VSCF state, the analog of the electronic Møller- Plesset perturbation theory is known as vibrational perturbation theory truncated at n-th order (VPTn), the analog of the coupled-cluster family of methods is the vibrational coupled- cluster approach (VCC), and the analog of the conﬁguration-interaction methodology is the vibrational conﬁguration-interaction (VCI), where mode-mode couplings are treated exactly (at least in the full-VCI limit). In Crystal23 we have implemented the VSCF and VCI methods for both molecules and solids. VSCF: Theoretical Remarks and Options Vibrational modes are distinguishable so that the M-mode wavefunction of a given vibrational conﬁguration n does not need to be antisymmetrized and can be written as a Hartree product of one-mode functions (modals): Φn(Q1, Q2, · · · , QM) ≡Φn(Q) = M Y i=1 φni i (Qi) , (8.43) where n = (n1, n2, · · · , ni, · · · , nM) is the vibrational conﬁguration vector of the quantum numbers of the M one-mode functions. For each given vibrational conﬁguration n, the VSCF method consists in looking for the variationally best form of the corresponding M one-mode functions. This is achieved by requiring that the expectation value of the full Hamiltonian is stationary: En = ⟨Φn|H|Φn⟩ where H = M X i=1 Ti + V (Q) , (8.44) with Ti = −1/2(∂2/∂Q2 i ) being the one-mode kinetic energy operator.

In the input above, the convergence threshold is set to 1·10−5 cm−1 and the mixing fraction to 40%. VCI: Theoretical Remarks and Options In the VCI method, the wave-function of each vibrational state s is written as a linear combi- nation of M-mode wave-functions of diﬀerent vibrational conﬁgurations in the form of Hartree products of modals as in Eq. (8.43): Ψs(Q) = Nconf X n=1 An,sΦn(Q) , (8.45) where the sum runs over Nconf conﬁgurations, each characterized by a vibrational conﬁguration vector n. The selection of the Nconf conﬁgurations determines the truncation of the VCI expansion. For each vibrational state s, the corresponding VCI wave-function and energy are obtained by solving the corresponding Schr¨ odinger equation HΨs = EsΨs. The VCI method can be expressed in matrix form as follows: HA = AE, where A is the squared matrix containing, column-wise, the coeﬃcients An,s of the eigenvectors, E is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and H is the VCI Hamiltonian matrix (of size Nconf × Nconf), whose elements are: Hm,n = ⟨Φm|H|Φn⟩. (8.46) The VCI method therefore reduces to the construction and diagonalization of the VCI Hamilto- nian matrix, from which all vibrational states are simultaneously determined. VSCF solutions can be used to express the modals in the VCI method (according to the so-called VCI@VSCF approach). The VCI method relies on the expansion of the wave-function of each vibrational state in terms of Nconf Hartree product functions describing diﬀerent vibrational conﬁgurations, as introduced in Eq. (8.45). The number Nconf of functions used in the VCI expansion is of critical importance with regard to both the accuracy and computational cost of the method. Indeed, the larger Nconf the better the description of the vibrational state but also the larger the size of the VCI Hamiltonian matrix in Eq. (8.46) to be diagonalized. In particular, this latter aspect is the main limiting factor to the application of standard VCI to the study of those systems where more than just a few vibration modes need to be coupled. Therefore, it is crucial to devise eﬀective schemes to reduce as much as possible the conﬁg- urational space used in the VCI expansion. We have implemented two such schemes, to be introduced below. The following strategies can be used: 246'},\n"," {'page_number': 246,\n","  'page_char_count': 2373,\n","  'page_word_count': 414,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 18,\n","  'page_token_count': 593.25,\n","  'text': '1. The ﬁrst strategy for the truncation of the VCI expansion consists in including only those vibrational conﬁgurations where there are a maximum of Nquanta excitation quanta involved. Formally, we can express this strategy as follows to say that only those conﬁg- urations satisfying the next condition are included in the expansion: M X i=1 ni ≤Nquanta ; (8.47) 2. A second strategy that we use to truncate the VCI expansion consists in setting a maxi- mum number of modes Nmodes that can be simultaneously excited in a given conﬁgura- tion. In other words, only those vibrational conﬁgurations where there are a maximum of Nmodes with ni ̸= 0 are used. The eﬀect of these two schemes on the truncation of the VCI expansion is documented in the references above. As regards Nmodes, let us note that, when working in terms of 2M4T or 3M4T representations of the PES, the VCI description converges for Nmodes = 3 and Nmodes = 4, respectively. In Crystal, after the calculation of the anharmonic terms of the PES, a VCI calculation can be activated by use of the VCI keyword. By activating a VCI calculation, a VSCF calculation will be automatically performed before it. The VCI keyword requires the setting of three mandatory parameters.

Note that even without insertion of the VSCF keyword, a VSCF calculation will be performed anyway before the VCI one. In this way, the VSCF solutions can be used as an initial guess of the VCI treatment. As mentioned above, the VCI keyword requires the setting of three mandatory parameters: the ﬁrst parameter in the ﬁrst row below the keyword sets Nquanta (6 in the example above), the second parameter in the ﬁrst row below the keyword sets Nmodes (3 in the example above), the only parameter in the second row below the keyword can be either 0 or 1 and governs the initial guess for the VCI treatment (0 implies a harmonic initial guess, 1 implies a VSCF initial guess). Use of the VCI@VSCF approach improves the convergence of the VCI expansion. 247'},\n"," {'page_number': 247,\n","  'page_char_count': 1290,\n","  'page_word_count': 173,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 9,\n","  'page_token_count': 322.5,\n","  'text': 'If instead one wants to run a VCI calculation on a previously computed harmonic and anhar- monic PES (from ﬁles FREQINFO.DAT and SCANPES.DAT), the input would read like: ...Optimized Geometry Input...

To do so, a harmonic approximation (HA) to the lattice potential is commonly adopted, which proves extremely eﬀective in predicting vibration properties (such as Infrared and Raman spectroscopic features, for instance) of a variety of materials, particularly so when very light atoms are not involved. However, when the lattice dynamics of a crystal is solved within the purely HA, vibration frequencies are described as independent of interatomic distances and the corresponding vi- brational contribution to the internal energy of the crystal turns out to be independent of volume. It follows that, within such an assumption, a variety of physical properties would be wrongly described: thermal expansion would be null, elastic constants would not depend on temperature, constant-pressure and constant-volume speciﬁc heats would coincide with each other, thermal conductivity would be inﬁnite as well as phonon lifetimes, etc. A simple and powerful approach for correcting most of the above mentioned deﬁciencies of the HA is represented by the so-called Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA), which introduces the missing volume dependence of phonon frequencies by retaining the harmonic expression for the Helmholtz free energy. This approach allows for the natural combination of temperature and pressure eﬀects. Depending on the temperature and pressure ranges to be explored, the lattice dynamics has to be solved at few volumes in the expansion and compression regime, respectively. Harmonic vibration frequencies and harmonic thermodynamic functions are computed by using the FREQCALC keyword since the Crystal03 version of the program.

Given the usual reciprocity between direct and reciprocal spaces, the size of the adopted SC (within the direct space approach) corresponds to the sampling of the FBZ. Use of the primitive cell would allow for the description of Γ modes only while a 3 × 3 × 3 SC would correspond to a 3 × 3 × 3 mesh of k-points in the FBZ, for instance. Increasing the size of the SC simply corresponds to increasing the sampling of the phonon dispersion in the FBZ in reciprocal space. 250'},\n"," {'page_number': 250,\n","  'page_char_count': 2390,\n","  'page_word_count': 442,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 11,\n","  'page_token_count': 597.5,\n","  'text': '9.1.2 Harmonic Lattice Dynamics To each k-point in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, 3M harmonic oscillators (i.e. phonons) are associ- ated, which are labeled by a phonon band index p (p = 1, . . . , 3M) and whose energy levels are given by the usual harmonic expression: εp,k m = \\x12 m + 1 2 \\x13 ωkp , (9.1) where m is an integer, ωkp = 2πνkp and M is the number of atoms per primitive cell.

Directional thermal expansion coeﬃcients αx(T) = 1/x(T)[∂x(T)/∂T] can also be computed where x can be the a, b or c lattice parameter. The anisotropy of the thermal expansion is obtained by optimizing the lattice parameters as a function of the purely internal energy E at diﬀerent volumes. A more accurate optimization of the lattice parameters with respect to the free energy F could be considered, which, however, would require a much larger set of calculations to be performed.

(9.11) Some experimental techniques for measuring the bulk modulus of a crystal involve elastic waves and are characterized by very short time-scales that prevent the system from reaching a thermal equilibrium; in these cases, an adiabatic bulk modulus, KS, is measured. Adiabatic and isothermal bulk moduli do coincide with each other at zero temperature only, KS always being larger than KT at any ﬁnite temperature. The QHA also oﬀers a way to compute the adiabatic bulk modulus from the isothermal one, given that: KS = KT + α2 V V TK2 T CV , (9.12) where the dependence of all quantities on temperature is omitted for clarity sake. One of the powerful advantages of the QHA is that of allowing for a natural combination of pressure and temperature eﬀects on structural and elastic properties of materials. By diﬀer- entiating equation (9.9) with respect to the volume and changing sign, the thermal pressure is obtained: P(V ; T) = −∂F QHA(V ; T) ∂V . (9.13) The description of the isothermal bulk modulus of the system at simultaneous high- temperatures and high-pressures, KT (P, T), can be obtained as an isothermal second derivative of equation (9.9) with respect to the volume and by exploiting relation (9.13): KT (P, T) = V (P, T) \\x12∂2F QHA(V (P, T); T) ∂V (P, T)2 \\x13 T . (9.14) Let us ﬁnally recall that the QHA allows for computing the diﬀerence between constant-pressure and constant-volume speciﬁc heats as follows: CP (T) −CV (T) = α2 V (T)K(T)V (T)T . (9.15) 9.1.4 Gr¨ uneisen Simpliﬁed Model Gr¨ uneisen formalism assumes a linear dependence of vibration phonon frequencies on volume, in the vicinity of the zero temperature equilibrium volume V0. The key quantity is here represented by the dimensionless mode Gr¨ uneisen parameter, which for each phonon reads: γkj = − V0 ωkj(V0) \\x12∂ωkj(V ) ∂V \\x13 V =V0 .

(9.17) Within Gr¨ uneisen approach, the volumetric thermal expansion is given by: αgru V (T) = 1 KV0 X kj γkj CV,kj(T) . (9.18) 9.2 The Automated Algorithm: Some Computational Parameters A fully-automated algorithm for computing quasi-harmonic thermal properties of solids has been implemented in the Crystal program, which relies on the direct ﬁtting of individual phonon frequencies, ωkp(V ), versus volume. Once phonon frequencies are known continuously as a function of volume, all other properties can indeed be analytically derived through the expressions reported above. In order to uniquely determine the continuity of phonon frequencies among diﬀerent volumes, correctly accounting for possible crossings, scalar products of the corresponding normal modes are performed. The deﬁnition of both the explored volume range and the number of considered volumes has been devised so as to make it as black-box as possible. Here, this fully-automated computational procedure is brieﬂy sketched and the main compu- tational parameters one can play with are introduced: • The starting geometrical structure of the system must be the zero-temperature, zero- pressure one. One can either start from a previously fully-optimized structure or use the PREOPTGEOM sub-keyword, within the QHA input block to activate an accurate initial optimization as concerns both lattice parameters and atomic positions. The zero- temperature, zero-pressure equilibrium volume V0 is determined (note that zero-point motion is neglected at this stage); • A volume range is deﬁned from a -s% compression to a +2s% expansion with respect to V0, where NV equidistant volumes are considered (possible values for NV are 4, 7 and 13, corresponding to equidistances of s%, s/2% and s/4%, respectively). At each volume, the structure is fully relaxed via a volume-constrained geometry optimization and phonon frequencies are computed. By default, the step s is set to 3% and NV to 4, which means that vibration frequencies are actually computed at 4 volumes covering a volume range from a −3% compression to a +6% expansion. The step amplitude s can be modiﬁed with the STEP sub-keyword and the number of considered volumes for frequency calculation NV with the POINTS sub-keyword as: Title Geometry input block QHA # Keyword to perform a Quasi-harmonic calculation STEP # Keyword to change volume step 3.5 # New step [3.5%] POINTS # Keyword to change number of volumes 7 # New number of volumes END # End of the Quasi-harmonic input block END # End of the Geometry input block Basis set block ... This is a graphical representation of the standard deﬁnition of the volume interval and number of volumes where vibration frequencies are actually computed: 253'},\n"," {'page_number': 253,\n","  'page_char_count': 2574,\n","  'page_word_count': 420,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 12,\n","  'page_token_count': 643.5,\n","  'text': 'Figure 9.1: Deﬁnition of volume step and number It is recommended to use the above standard deﬁnition for the explored volume range. However, if diﬀerent volume ranges have to be explored (for instance more oriented towards compression than expansion), the sub-keyword VRANGE can be used, which allows for a more customized deﬁnition (the syntax is the same as for the same option in the EOS, equation-of-state, block); • Once all volumes have been considered, purely electronic internal energies as a function of volume are ﬁtted to various equations-of-state. The third-order Birch-Murnaghan is the one to be used for subsequent thermodynamic purposes. The continuity of phonon frequencies on volume is determined before individually ﬁtting them as a function of volume with polynomial functions of diﬀerent orders, up to third order (a second-order polynomial ﬁt is used as a default). For each phonon mode p, a coeﬃcient of determina- tion R2 p is computed, which measures the goodness-of-ﬁt (the closer R2 to 1, the better the ﬁtting). An average index over all modes R 2 is also deﬁned which gives an overall measure of the regularity of all computed frequencies on volume. If low values of R2 p are found for some modes, warnings will be printed in the output as one can not expect a good quasi-harmonic description from irregular vibration frequencies as a function of volume; • From ﬁtted frequencies, at any considered temperature T the Helmholtz free energy is evaluated through equations (9.8) and (9.9) at several volumes, minimized for deter- mining the corresponding equilibrium volume V (T) and ﬁtted for getting K(T) from its second derivative. By ﬁtting V (T) data to a polynomial function and by taking its temperature derivative, the thermal expansion coeﬃcient αV (T) of equation (9.10) can then be computed numerically. All computed thermal properties are evaluated at a series of temperature values to be deﬁned by means of the TEMPERAT sub-keyword (by default 50 temperatures would otherwise be considered from 10 K to 300 K). Given that some properties are obtained as numerical derivatives with respect to temperature (as the thermal expansion coeﬃcient), at least 50 temperature values must be considered. The desired set of temperatures can be modiﬁed as: Title Geometry input block QHA # Keyword to perform a Quasi-harmonic calculation TEMPERAT # Keyword to change temperature range 100 10 2000 # 100 temperature values from 10 K to 2000 K END # End of the Quasi-harmonic input block END # End of the Geometry input block Basis set block ... 254'},\n"," {'page_number': 254,\n","  'page_char_count': 1856,\n","  'page_word_count': 306,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 15,\n","  'page_token_count': 464.0,\n","  'text': '9.2.1 Optional Keywords This is a list of some possible (optional) sub-keywords to be inserted after QHA.

Its components, Cvu, are the elastic stiﬀness constants of the system. The QHA provides a couple of schemes to compute the thermal dependence of such quantities: the so-called thermo-elasticity of the material. The static elastic constants are expressed as: Cvu = 1 V0 ∂2E ∂ηv ∂ηu \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c η=0 (9.19) where E is the internal static energy and V0 is the volume of the system after a standard geometry optimization - which gives the structure corresponding to the minimum of E. In Crystal, a fully automated algorithm for the determination of the static elastic constants can be exploited by means of the ELASTCON keyword. Instead, the expression for the thermo-elastic constants is the following one: CT vu(T) = 1 V (T) ∂2F ∂ηv ∂ηu \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c η=0 (9.20) This makes use of the Helmholtz free energy F (which of course includes the thermal contri- butions) and takes into account the thermal expansion of the system, V (T). Equation (9.20) yields the thermo-elastic constants referring to isothermal conditions - that’s why they are labelled CT vu(T). In order to compute them, the Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA) may be used: the phonon frequencies are computed at the harmonic level but at several unit cell volumes and strained lattice conﬁgurations. Because the phonon frequencies are computationally expensive to determine, the full QHA model above can become quite computationally expensive. By contrast, a plain static approach as in Eq. (9.19) is not able to predict any thermal dependence of the elastic constants. A compromise to this problem is oﬀered by the so-called Quasi-Static Approximation (QSA): CT vu(T) = 1 V (T) ∂2E ∂ηv ∂ηu \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c η=0 (9.21) This model assumes that most of the thermal eﬀects on the elastic response can be taken into account by considering the thermal expansion of the system only; the lattice potential energy is still approximated with the internal static energy E - which does not include any thermal contribution. The result is a quick answer to the thermal dependence of the elasticity. Although this may not be as accurate as the full QHA, it is certainly much better with respect to a merely static description. In order to implement Equation (9.20) two ingredients are needed: • The thermal expansion of the compound, V (T); • The second-order derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to the strain, ∂2F ∂η2 The thermal expansion of the system can be determined by an isotropic QHA calculation. This functionality can be exploited by means of the QHA keyword discussed above. 9.4.1 Formal Aspects of the Implementation The stiﬀness constants express the elastic response of a crystal with respect to a couple of deformations. Therefore, the determination of the whole elastic tensor requires the exploration of the elastic potential energy surface of the system over all the couples of strain directions. Due to the complexity of this task, the problem must be tackled by exploring a speciﬁc direction at a time. First of all, the strain vector η is expressed as a product of a scalar amplitude η and a vector shape η′: η = η η′ (9.22) 264'},\n"," {'page_number': 264,\n","  'page_char_count': 2565,\n","  'page_word_count': 412,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 18,\n","  'page_token_count': 641.25,\n","  'text': 'The shape of the strain, η′, is then kept ﬁxed; the variable is just its amplitude η. In this way, the elastic potential energy surface is explored only in the direction deﬁned by such strain shape: this“surface” is actually seen as a mono-dimensional curve. Its second-order derivative (which is a directional derivative with respect to the surface) will lead to a speciﬁc scalar elastic constant. The scalar elastic constants obtained from the strain direction η′ is labelled C′: C′(T) = 1 V (T) \\x12∂2F ∂η2 \\x13 η′ \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c η=0 (9.23) Of course, the full elastic tensor contains the complete information of the spatial dependence of the elasticity phenomenon. Indeed, this particular scalar constant C′ is just a projection of the stiﬀness tensor C over twice the direction η′. Therefore, such matrix projection can be determined by the following formula (which is analogous to the projection of a vector over another one): C′(T) = X vu Cvu(T) η′ v η′ u (9.24) where the summation runs over the two indexes v and u, both ranging from 1 to 6. That is, this particular elastic constant corresponds to a linear combination of the basic ones (i.e. the elements of the elastic tensor), where the weights depend on the selected direction (strain shape). 9.4.2 Computing Thermo-Elastic Constants with CRYSTAL In order to take into account thermal eﬀects, a semi-automated algorithm for the thermo- elasticity has been developed, which consists of the following steps (to be run separately in sequence): 1. A full geometry optimization (keyword OPTGEOM), which yields the equilibrium structure; 2. An isotropic QHA calculation (keyword QHA), which gives the thermal expansion of the material (i.e. the volume-temperature relation V (T)); 3. A value of temperature of interest is selected T, and the corresponding volume V (T) determined from the previous step; 4. A constant-volume geometry optimization (keyword CVOLOPT) is performed so that the expanded equilibrium structure at this temperature is determined; 5. A strain shape η′ is selected and the actual thermo-elastic calculation can be carried out (with the keyword THERMOELAS to be illustrated below). The result of this calculation will be the C′(T) scalar elastic constant relative to the strain shape η′ at the selected temperature T. By performing several calculations with diﬀerent strain shapes, it is possible to determine the whole elastic tensor; by performing several calculations with diﬀerent temperature values, it is possible to obtain the thermal dependence of the elastic response of the system. 265'},\n"," {'page_number': 265,\n","  'page_char_count': 1774,\n","  'page_word_count': 275,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 21,\n","  'page_token_count': 443.5,\n","  'text': 'The keyword THERMOELAS (to be inserted into the ELASTCON input block) requires the deﬁnition of two records: the selected temperature T (in Kelvin) and the strain shape η′ (expressed in the Voigt notation as a vector of six integers).

Now we will address this point: given that we are interested in a speciﬁc elastic constant, how can we choose a proper strain shape? Diagonal Thermo-Elastic Constants The generic diagonal elastic constant Cvv can be directly determined by choosing the corre- sponding basic strain shape - the one having only the v-th component set to 1 and all the others set to 0. For instance, C22 can be easily obtained by choosing η′ = [ 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]. In fact, since only η′ 2 is non-zero, only the desired term survives in the summation of Equation (9.24): C′ = X vu Cvu η′ v η′ u ≡C22 (9.25) The same holds for C44 (by choosing η′ = [ 0 0 0 1 0 0 ], the resulting scalar elastic constant is indeed the desired one) and for all other diagonal elastic constants Cvv. Oﬀ-Diagonal Thermo-Elastic Constants The oﬀ-diagonal elastic constants Cvu require a bit more eﬀort to be determined, because they can only be computed embedded into a linear combination containing also other constants. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use a composite strain shape consisting of the two involved basic ones - i.e. having the v-th and u-th components set to 1 with all the others set to 0. For instance, in order to obtain the C23 elastic constant, start by choosing η′ = [ 0 1 1 0 0 0 ]. According to Eq. (9.24), this will lead to a scalar elastic constant: C′ = X vu Cvu η′ v η′ u = C22 + C23 + C32 + C33 = C22 + 2C23 + C33 (9.26) This scalar constant clearly contains C23, but in a combination with C22 and C33. These are diagonal terms, which are easy to be determined as just described above. Once these have been computed, it is possible to remove their contributions from the linear combination - leading to the desired result: C23 = 1 2 (C′ −C22 −C33) (9.27) Now you get the idea. For instance, the same holds for C36: by choosing η′ = [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ], the resulting scalar elastic constant is C′ = C33 + 2C36 + C66 and once C33 and C66 are known, C36 can be determined by diﬀerence. Symmetry-Preserving Strains Up until now, we have not yet taken into account the internal symmetry of the system: the rules described so far are completely general and valid for all oﬀ-diagonal constants. However, diﬀer- ent linear combinations of strain shapes can be identiﬁed that are more symmetry-preserving than others: in this way the computation will be much faster. For instance, let’s consider a cubic system (for which C11 = C22 = C33 and C12 = C13 = C23 ). We already know that the C12 may be determined with η′ = [ 1 1 0 0 0 0 ]. However this deformation will strain the system along the x and y directions, reducing the symmetry to the tetragonal one. Instead, it is more convenient to choose η′ = [ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ] because it preserves the cubic symmetry. This will lead to a scalar elastic constant given by: C′ = X vu Cvu η′ v η′ u = C11+C12+C13+C21+C22+C23+C31+C32+C33 = 3 (C11 + 2C12) (9.28) As usual, once C11 is known, C12 can be determined by diﬀerence from this combination. Note that this particular deformation is isotropic. As it turns out, we can completely avoid to perform the calculation having this strain shape. This is because the isotropic QHA calculation 267'},\n"," {'page_number': 267,\n","  'page_char_count': 3441,\n","  'page_word_count': 555,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 24,\n","  'page_token_count': 860.25,\n","  'text': 'has already been performed (this is a prerequisite of the thermo-elastic one). Therefore, it is possible to make use of the thermal dependence of the bulk modulus (given as a result of the QHA calculation), because it is a linear combination of the elastic constants: K = 1 9 (C11 + C22 + C33 + 2C12 + 2C13 + 2C23) (9.29) In other words, the isotropic QHA already provides one of the equations for the linear system involving the thermo-elastic constants. 9.4.4 Optional Sub-Keywords of the Thermo-Elastic Calculation The thermo-elastic calculation THERMOELAS , being a sub-section of the ELASTCON keyword, makes use of the corresponding options. With THERMOELAS the elasticity is described in terms of Equation (9.20) where the free energy surface is explored along one direction at a time, through Equation (9.23). The derivative in the right-hand-side of Equation (9.23) is computed numerically by applying ﬁnite strains to the crystal lattice (see Figure 9.4.2). As we said earlier, these strains have a ﬁxed shape η′ deﬁned by the user in the input. The set of strain amplitudes {ηi} is determined according to the number of strained conﬁgurations Ns (keyword NUMDERIV, with a default value of 5) and the strain step size δ (keyword STEPSIZE, with a default value of 0.005). Hence, the actual strain matrices are determined and applied to the lattice, leading to deformed conﬁgurations. Now, for each deformed conﬁguration, atomic position are relaxed through an internal geometry optimization: this accounts for the nuclear contribution to the elasticity of the crystal. At this point the harmonic frequency calculation is carried out: the Hessian of the energy is determined by performing Cartesian atomic displacements of the system. The number of displacements per Cartesian atomic coordinate may be set through the keyword HNUMDERIV. Such parameter is 1 by default (meaning that the derivatives are performed by one-sided ﬁnite diﬀerence expressions) but may also be set to 2 (implying a two-sided ﬁnite diﬀerence formula). The amplitude of each atomic Cartesian displacement has a pre-deﬁned value of 0.006 ˚ A (for a standard equilibrium harmonic frequency calculation the default is 0.003 ˚ A; however, since the system is expanding, we have found that a higher value is able to provide more stable results) and may be adjusted by using the keyword HSTEPSIZE. From the frequencies of the system, the Helmholtz free energy is determined (through the vibrational partition function). At this point, the free energies of all the strained conﬁgurations are gathered. A polynomial regression is then performed over this set of data, leading to an estimation of the free energy as a function of the strain amplitude. By default only the quadratic ﬁt is performed (this is the most stable one). The keyword PRINT may be used to request for all the available ﬁts to be printed in output - from 3 regression parameters up to the number of strained conﬁgurations. From the polynomial free energy function, its derivative can be determined trivially. By normalizing this value by the volume of the system, the elastic constant is obtained and printed. All these calculated elastic constants refer to isothermal conditions - indeed, these should be labelled CT vu. Experimental values are often measured under adiabatic conditions CS vu. In order to convert one set of constants to the other, the adiabatic correction has to be applied. 268'},\n"," {'page_number': 268,\n","  'page_char_count': 1421,\n","  'page_word_count': 293,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 18,\n","  'page_token_count': 355.25,\n","  'text': 'Chapter 10 Dielectric Properties up to Fourth Order via the Coupled Perturbed HF/KS Method 10.1 Response to an Electric Field - Theoretical Frame- work of the Coupled-Perturbed Treatment The total energy E of a crystal in a constant static electric ﬁeld ε can be expressed as E(ε) = E(0) − X t µtεt −1 2!

The DIIS procedure requires the storage of error matrices for each cycle of the history. By default the information of all the previous iterations is kept, which can result in a signiﬁcant occupation of disk space if the procedure goes on for several (50, 100) cycles. The maximum number of cycles to be used as an history can be set by the HISTDIIS keyword. By default DIIS evaluates errors only in the gamma-point of the Brillouin zone. DIISALLK activates the DIIS procedure in all k-points with a resulting better accuracy – in principle at least – at the price of signiﬁcantly increased memory/storage requirements. From the experience gathered so far, the default (gamma-point) DIIS proved to work well in most – if not all – cases. 10.2.2 Dynamic (Frequency-dependent) CPHF/KS The CPHF/KS procedure described above refers to the response to a static ﬁeld.

Such a |D|d position (in Wyckoﬀ’s notation) is occupied by the atomic species A. Suppose that a diﬀerent atomic species X can replace A in any proportion on d. Then, |D| + 1 compositions are possible: A|D|−αXα , α = 0 . . . |D| (11.1) For each composition, there exist |Sα| = \\x12 |D| α \\x13 = |D|! α!(|D| −α)!

Figure 11.1 shows the set of conﬁgurations for two atomic species (A and X) distributed over four positions. As the group of symmetry G acts on the whole set of conﬁgurations (S), the latter is partitioned in |∆(S)| classes of equivalence, each one being a symmetry-independent class (SIC). Two conﬁgurations belong to the same SIC if there exists at least one element of G that transforms one conﬁguration into the other.

It allows to calculate the number of classes as a function of the composition and provides a representative for each class. In the present implementation: • the number of diﬀerent atomic species is restricted to two (A and X); • substitutions might take place on one or more crystallographic irreducible sites; for each irreducible site, all the symmetry equivalent positions are involved. The minimal CONFCNT input is as follows: rec variable meaning • A CONFCNT • ∗NIS number of irreducible sites • ∗IAT(I),I=1,NIS atomic label of each irreducible site • A END end of the CONFCNT sub-block This yields the number of SIC over the full range of (NIS+1) compositions corresponding to NIS irreducible crystallographic positions. For each SIC, a representative conﬁguration is given, along with its multiplicity and the number of symmetry operators of its group (being a subgroup of the group of the original cell). The representative conﬁgurations are printed in lexicographic order. By default, the replacing species is labeled as ’XX’.

Further optional keywords, namely SYMONLY and SYASYM, manage a tuned probability distribution according to whether the SIC are symmetric (that is having symmetry operators other than the identity) or not. SYMONLY, in particular, sets to 0 the probability of asymmetric SIC. Then, by using a large number of tries NTC, all the simmetric SIC might be found at no signiﬁcant computational cost.

The basis set complete with the functions for atom IZB must be given in input after the SCF block: the keyword BASE opens a new input block where a standard basis set must be inserted (Section 3.2).

Therefore, it necessary to perform a CONFRAND preliminarly (see 279). Then, CONFNEIG writes a ﬁle named CONFNEIGHBORS.DAT, which contains a list of canoni- cal conﬁgurations generated from the speciﬁed SIC (i.e., IRANK), by exchange of a couple of atoms of diﬀerent colors. The unit CONFNEIGHBORS.DAT has the same ﬁle format as CON- FIGURATIONS.DAT. So, it can be read by the option RUNCONFS for running calculations on the conﬁgurations listed therein (280). Suppose you have already run calculations on a certain number of SICs among those found by CONFRAND in the ﬁrst place. You may want to exclude these SICs from the subsequent listing performed by CONFNEIG, in order to avoid making duplicate calculations. The optional keyword RANKLIST (to be inserted in the CONFNEIG sub-block) serves the purpose, when the list of SICs to be avoided is provided in a ﬁle named RANK.LST.

Each of these keywords opens a block which must be terminated with an END keyword. 13.1 A few theoretical remarks The elements of the elastic tensor, for 3D systems, are usually deﬁned as: Cvu = 1 V ∂2E ∂ηv∂ηu \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c 0 , (13.1) where η is the rank-2 symmetric tensor of pure strain and Voigt’s notation is used according to which v, u = 1, . . . , 6 (1 = xx, 2 = yy, 3 = zz, 4 = yz, 5 = xz, 6 = xy). Since volume V is not uniquely deﬁned for 1D and 2D systems, it is here omitted (length or surface could be used instead) and all the elements involving non-periodic directions (y, z for 1D and z for 2D systems) are null by deﬁnition. As a consequence, for 1D and 2D systems, elastic constants are expressed in energy units (hartree). Second derivatives in equation (13.1) are computed as ﬁrst numerical derivatives of analytical energy gradients in the present implementation. In the linear regime, direct e and converse d piezoelectric tensors describe the polarization P induced by strain η and the strain induced by an external electric ﬁeld E at constant electric ﬁeld and stress, respectively: direct eﬀect P = e η at constant ﬁeld (13.2) converse eﬀect η = dT E at constant stress (13.3) Our approach consists in directly computing the intensity of polarization induced by strain (again, since the volume is not deﬁned for 1D and 2D systems, in those cases the polarization reduces to a dipole moment). The Cartesian components of the polarization can then be expressed as follows in terms of the strain tensor components: Pi = X v eivηv so that eiv = \\x12∂Pi ∂ηv \\x13 E .

The latter scheme is used in the present automated implementation according to which direct piezoelectric constants can be written as follows in terms of numerical ﬁrst derivatives of the BP ϕl with respect to the strain: eiv = |e| 2πV X l ali ∂ϕl ∂ηv , (13.5) where ali is the i-th Cartesian component of the l-th direct lattice basis vector al. Again, for 1D and 2D systems, the volume is omitted, the polarization reduces to a dipole moment and the piezoelectric constants are reported in units of |e| × bohr. An alternative approach has recently been implemented for the analytical evaluation of the direct piezoelectric tensor of 3D crystals, based on the CPHF/KS scheme. This strategy is adopted when use of the keyword PIEZOCP is made. A simple direct connection exists between direct e and converse d piezoelectric tensors: e = d C and d = e S , (13.6) where C is the fourth rank elastic tensor of energy second derivatives with respect to pairs of deformations and S = C−1 is the fourth rank compliance tensor. Photoelastic constants are the elements of the fourth rank photoelastic (Pockels) tensor and are deﬁned as: pijkl = ∂∆ϵ−1 ij ∂ηkl , (13.7) where ∆ϵ−1 is the diﬀerence of the inverse dielectric tensor between strained and unstrained conﬁgurations. Given the stress-strain relation, the fourth-rank piezo-optic tensor π (whose elements are the stress-optical coeﬃcients πvu) can be obtained from the photo-elastic p and elastic C ones as: π = p S and p = π C . (13.8) At variance with the elastic C and compliance S tensors, p and π are not symmetric (i.e. in general pvu ̸= puv and πvu ̸= πuv). It follows that the number of symmetry-independent components to be determined for the stress-optical and strain-optical tensors is generally larger than for the elastic tensors. The derivatives in the right-hand-sides of equations (13.1), (13.5) and (13.7) are computed numerically by applying ﬁnite strains to the crystal lattice. For each strain, Ns conﬁgurations are deﬁned according to a strain step δ. By default, Ns = 3, corresponding to one “expanded”, one unstrained and one “contracted” conﬁguration, and δ = 0.01 for elastic and δ = 0.015 for piezoelectric and photoelastic constants. Parameter Ns can be modiﬁed with the sub-keyword NUMDERIV while δ can be modiﬁed with sub-keyword STEPSIZE. We recall that elastic, piezoelectric and photoelastic constants can be decomposed into purely electronic “clamped-ion” and nuclear “internal-strain” contributions; the latter, computed by default, measures the eﬀect of relaxation of the relative positions of atoms induced by the strain and can be computed by optimizing the atomic positions within the crystal cell. If one wants to compute “clamped-ion” constants can use the sub-keyword CLAMPION. The input geometry is assumed to be optimized; nevertheless, the user can ask this mod- ule to perform a pre-optimization of the structure by means of the PREOPTGEOM sub- keyword; convergence tolerances on gradient and displacement can be modiﬁed by means of the TOLDEG and TOLDEX sub-keywords. For elastic, piezoelectric and photoelastic constants a ﬂexible restart option has been prepared which can be activated with the RESTART sub-keyword and which uses an external format- ted ﬁle called ELASINFO.DAT. Detailed printings (recommended) can be activated with the PRINT sub-keyword. 13.2 The algorithm We present here the fully automated procedure for the calculation of the elastic, piezoelectric and photoelastic constants as implemented in Crystal: 289'},\n"," {'page_number': 289,\n","  'page_char_count': 2851,\n","  'page_word_count': 471,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 56,\n","  'page_token_count': 712.75,\n","  'text': '1.

Chem. Phys., 140, 124703 (2014). The calculation of elastic constants under pressure is a task of great geophysical interest. In the absence of any ﬁnite pre-stress, elastic constants can be deﬁned as second energy density derivatives with respect to pairs of inﬁnitesimal Eulerian strains: Cijkl = 1 V0 \\x12 ∂2E ∂ϵij∂ϵkl \\x13 ϵ=0 . (13.10) The constants above do represent the link between stress and strain via the Hooke’s law. In the limit of zero temperature, typical of ab initio simulations, they are also referred to as athermal elastic constants. If a ﬁnite pre-stress σpre is applied in the form of a hydrostatic pressure P (σpre ij = Pδij), within the frame of ﬁnite Eulerian strain, the relevant elastic stiﬀness constants are transformed as: Bijkl = Cijkl + P 2 (2δijδkl −δilδjk −δikδjl) , (13.11) provided that V0 in equation 13.10 becomes the equilibrium volume V (P) at pressure P. In the present fully automated implementation of the calculation of the stiﬀness tensor B (and of S = B−1, the compliance tensor) under pressure, V (P) is obtained from the analytical stress tensor. An option also exists for using the V (P) relation obtained from a previous EOS calculation. Since both ϵ and δ are symmetric tensors, we can rewrite the previous equality as: Bvu = Cvu + \\uf8eb \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ed 0 P P 0 0 0 P 0 P 0 0 0 P P 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −P 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 −P 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 −P 2 \\uf8f6 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f8 , (13.12) where Voigt’s notation has been used. 293'},\n"," {'page_number': 293,\n","  'page_char_count': 3133,\n","  'page_word_count': 469,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 48,\n","  'page_token_count': 783.25,\n","  'text': 'So, in order to obtain the elastic constants at a given pressure, one basically needs to perform an elastic calculation at the volume corresponding to the desired pressure, V (P), and then correct the computed constants according to equation 13.12.

Chem., 38, 257-264 (2017) Strain-induced response properties of solids can be formally decomposed into a purely elec- tronic “clamped-nuclei” term and a nuclear-relaxation term due to the rearrangement of atomic positions upon strain. The evaluation of the latter is generally much more computationally ex- pensive than that of the former. In principle, two alternative approaches can be used to account for nuclear-relaxation eﬀects: i) performing numerical geometry optimizations to relax atomic positions at actual strained lattice conﬁgurations, or ii) evaluating in a more analytical fashion the “internal-strain” tensor of energy second-derivatives with respect to atomic displacements and lattice deformations, as combined with the interatomic force constant Hessian matrix.

As a matter of fact, in previous versions of the Crystal program, only the ﬁrst numerical strategy was available. In Crystal17, the second approach has been implemented for the elastic and piezoelectric tensors, which relies on the calculation of the “internal-strain” tensor by fully-exploiting its point-symmetry features. Beside being more robust, the new strategy has also been documented to be more computationally eﬃcient for most crystalline systems. The elements of the force-response internal-strain tensor are second-energy derivatives with respect to an atomic displacement and to a lattice distortion: Λai,v = ∂2E ∂uai∂ηv \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c E , (13.13) where uai are Cartesian components of the displacement vector ua of atom a (i=x, y, z). A displacement-response internal-strain tensor Γ, which describes ﬁrst-order atomic displace- ments as induced by a ﬁrst-order strain, can be deﬁned as: Γai,v = −∂uai ∂ηv \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c E = X bj (H−1)ai,bjΛbj,v , (13.14) where H is the interatomic force-constant Hessian matrix of energy second derivatives with respect to pairs of periodicity-preserving atomic displacements: Hai,bj = ∂2E ∂uai∂ubj \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c E,η . (13.15) When mass-weighted and diagonalized, the force-constant matrix of Eq. (13.15) provides vibration frequencies of Brillouin zone-center phonon modes. The H−1 matrix in Eq. (13.14) has to be considered a pseudoinverse of H where translational degrees of freedom are projected out, as discussed in detail elsewhere. The nuclear-relaxation contribution to elastic constants can be expressed in terms of the internal-strain tensor Λ (or Γ): Cnuc vw = −1 V0 X ai Λai,vΓai,w , (13.16) In the current fully-automated implementation into the Crystal program, the elements Λai,v of the force-response internal-strain tensor are here computed as ﬁnite diﬀerences of analytical lattice gradients with respect to atomic Cartesian displacements, by means of a generalized “Pulay’s force method” originally proposed for interatomic force constants.

When all the starting and terminal points are chosen to coincide with special (high symmetry) ones, it is possible to write the conventional label of each point instead of its coordinates (this option is activated by putting ISS=0). These labels have to be expressed as letters in the latin alphabet: the Γ point is identiﬁed by letter G. Apart from Γ, the labels of the special points are diﬀerent for each Bravais lattice: the convention adopted for the special points and their position in the Brillouin zone can be found in tables 14.1 and 14.2 below.

Compton Proﬁles (CPs) can be computed by Fourier transforming the RFF with the PROF sub-keyword below. The starting auto-correlation function must be of good quality in order to get good CPs. Both RFFs and CPs can be convoluted (see CONV sub-keyword) in order to be compared with the experiments (aﬀected by the ﬁnite resolution of the spectrometer); this procedure is performed by multiplying the RFF by the gaussian function g(r)σr: g(r)σr = e −r2 2σ2 r where σr = 1 σp = 2√2log2 FWHMp where FWHMp, the convolution parameter, has to be deﬁned in input by the user (in atomic units); the r and p subscripts identify quantities in coordinates and momentum space, respec- tively. The anisotropies of the RFFs and the CPs can be evaluated via the DIFF sub-keyword. This block must be ended by ENDB. It works also for open-shell systems. 310'},\n"," {'page_number': 310,\n","  'page_char_count': 706,\n","  'page_word_count': 222,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 3,\n","  'page_token_count': 176.5,\n","  'text': 'Table 14.1: Labels and fractional coordinates (referred to reciprocal space lattice parameters of the primitive cell) of the special points recognized in input for each Bravais lattice.

The NEWK option must be executed (to compute Hartree-Fock/KS eigenvectors and eigenvalues) before running DOSS. The values of the input parameters IS and ISP of NEWK have a consequent eﬀect on the accuracy of the DOSS calculation. Suggested values for IS: from 4 to 12 for 3-D systems, from 6 to 18 for 2-D and 1-D systems (Section 18.7, page 406).

To compute density of states and bands, the sequence must be: BAND - NEWK - DOSS. 3.

But in contrast to the DOS, a COOP/COHP calculation is speciﬁcally aimed at the interaction between two selected groups of orbitals/atoms. Thus, information regarding bonding and anti- bonding states, bond orders, and interaction strengths can be obtained in a straightforward fashion. The diﬀerence between the COOP and COHP analyses lie in the usage of either the overlap matrix (S) or the Hamiltonian matrix (H) elements for COOP and COHP, respectively. The former provides a measure of the bond order, while the latter a measure of bond strength. The mathematical form is very similar to that of a projected DOS equation: COOPA−B(ϵ) = 2 VB X j X µ∈A X ν∈B Z BZ Sµν(k)a∗ µj(k)aνj(k)δ(ϵ −ϵj(k))dk COHPA−B(ϵ) = 2 VB X j X µ∈A X ν∈B Z BZ Hµν(k)a∗ µj(k)aνj(k)δ(ϵ −ϵj(k))dk Two keywords are available to compute these quantities: COOP and COHP. As with the calculation of the density of states, the COOP/COHP calculations require the Fock/KS eigenvectors at each k point deﬁned by Pack-Monkhorst net, which need to be recal- culated using the keyword NEWK. The INPUT format for the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) and the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) calculations are essentially identical, and both can be run simultaneously.

The localization of Wannier Functions (WnF) is controlled by parameters. Default values are supplied for all parameters. Optional keywords allow modiﬁcation of the default choices, recommended to developers only. The LOCALWF block is closed by the END keyword. For UHF calculations two set of blocks must be inserted for the α and β electrons, each one ending with the keyword END. 1. The NEWK option must be executed before running LOCALWF, to compute theBloch functions. 2. The number of k points required for a good localization depends on the characteristics of the bands chosen. For core electrons or valence bands in non-conducting materials, an IS slightly larger than that used in the SCF part is enough to provide well localized WnFs. For valence bands in semiconductors or conduction bands the k-point net is required to be denser, but there are no recipes to determine a priori the optimum IS value. The IS value chosen determines a Born-von Karman supercell (or cyclic cluster) from which the program a priori estimates the memory space that should be enough to contain all WnF coeﬃcients lower than the threshold 10−IT DP (see the meaning of ITDP in what follows) in real space. The size of this crystal domain in terms of unit cells is provided in output before the localization procedure. If the crystal domain is too small usually the localization fails and IS must be increased. On the other hand, if it is too large (very large IS) the memory space reserved for the WnF coeﬃcients becomes overestimated and the calculation may stop because of a lack of memory for array allocation. 3. The eﬃciency of the localization can be controlled using the CYCTOL parameters. In most cases, increasing ITDP and/or ICONV leads to larger and more accurate localiza- tion of the WnFs. 4. The RESTART option admits MAXCYCLE = 0, then the program just reconstructs all the information about the WnFs given in ﬁle fort.81 but does not continue the lo- calization. This two options together with a IS=1 in NEWK is useful to perform the analysis of the WnFs after localization by means of the PRINTPLO option.

The last option is recommended when a sequence of CRYSCOR calculations are to be per- formed corresponding each time to small geometrical changes. Accordingly, to ensure a smooth evolution of the energy and wave function, all indices concerning the symmetry and the label- ing of the WnFs are kept to be the same along the sequence. This is required in particular in geometry optimizations and scanning along geometrical parameters (for instance: in the calculation of molecular physisorption energy curves – see the CRYSCOR Users’s Manual and the CRYSCOR Tutorials for a detailed description of the procedure).

Symmetry adaptation of Wannier Functions SYMMWF The WnFs a-posteriori symmetrization procedure [45], activated by the SYMMWF keyword, is mandatory in the case of a subsequent CRYSCOR calculations. A brief outline of the procedure can help to orient in the particular nomenclature adopted to deﬁne the symmetrized WnFs and their symmetry relations. 1. after the localization step, the WnFs are centered at diﬀerent Wickoﬀsites of the reference cell which are invariant with respect to point-symmetry subgroup H of the space group G of the crystal; 2. for each site, a coset decomposition of G by H is performed, thus leading to the deﬁnition of NF = |G| |H| symmetry operators (coset representatives) which rotate the reference site into equivalent ones; 3. among each set of equivalent sites, a reference site is chosen; 4. the WnFs of the reference site are symmetrized according to the corresponding subgroup H: each of these symmetrized WnFs is basis of an irreducible representations (IRREP) of the subgroup H and hereafter each component of the irreducible basis set will be referred to as petal; 5. the collection of petals belonging to the same IRREP of H ,the whole irreducible basis set, constitutes a so-called ﬂower. It is worth noting that bi/three-dimensional IRREPs gives rise to ﬂower made up of two/three petals, respectively; 6. the rotation of the reference ﬂower performed by means of the corresponding NF -1 coset representatives (identity excluded) yields the creation of others NF -1 symmetry related ﬂowers; the set of such equivalent ﬂowers constitutes a bunch; 7. in general, more than one bunch could be associated to the same reference site; 8. as a result of this procedure, each WnF is fully classiﬁed by four indices |b,f,p,g⟩(b = bunch, f=ﬂower, p= petal, g= crystal cell) such that a general symmetry operator of the system b R ∈G, applied to a WnF gives: b R |b,f,p,g⟩= P p′[A(R)]pp′ |b,fR,p’,gR⟩. In addition to the general keywords of the localization step, a set of optional keywords, recom- mended to developers only, can be used to modify some default settings.

The solution can be eventually improved by tuning some computational parameters; in partic- ular the user can: • set tighter tolerances for the evaluation of two-electron integrals in the HF reference solution (TOLINTEG): despite the increase of computational time, it turns out that the localization procedure is particularly sensitive to the the ﬁrst threshold; • increase the number of k points (NEWK) according to the suggestions reported in the LO- CALWF introduction paragraph; • use more severe values for the short and large cycles tolerances (CYCTOL).

We call it the ”cyclic cluster”. The volume of this region depends on the shrinking factor used in the previous NEWK. For instance, if IS=4, then the cyclic cluster in a 3D system will be 4**3 times larger than the primitive cell. For the localization part to work the WnFs are required to be described in the real space, hence the cyclic conditions and the WnFs are mapped onto a cluster in direct space. The size of this cluster where the localization is performed is deﬁned as follows: 1. We deﬁne a small cluster, as a spherical region that contains the minimum number of G-vectors that fully map the cyclic cluster. Let’ s call RO its radius. 2. As the centroid of some WnFs may be at the border of the reference cell we should consider some additional space in the direct cluster so as to allow the tails to be fully included in the region. This additional distance R1 is calculated as the maximum G- vector modulus of the set of cells at the neighbours of the reference one. 3.

The numerical integration is extended to a sphere (radius RINT) where EMD is sampled at the points of a commensurate net characterized by a shrinking factor IS (in the IBZ) and at all the points (with modulus less then RINT) obtained from these by applying reciprocal lattice translations. It is possible to deﬁne a second sphere (with radius REST); in the volume between the two spheres a second net is employed with shrinking factor IS1 greater then IS. IRAP=IS1/IS is given in INPUT card 2; a reasonable value is IRAP=2. The outer contribution is supposed to be the same for diﬀerent CP’s, and is obtained by integrating the average EMD. 4. If ICORE ̸= 2 (valence electron CP’s are required) the NEWK option, with IFE=1, must be run before the PROF option, in order to generate the eigenvectors required for the EMD calculation, as well as the weights associated with each k point. 5. If ICORE ̸= 2 and IVIA = 0 the CPs are evaluated at points resulting from the IS partition of the reciprocal lattice translators. The interpolation is performed at STPJ intervals (STPJ is given in input). If ICORE = 2 or IVIA = 1 the CPs are, in any case, evaluated at points resulting from STPJ intervals. IVIA=0 (numerical integration) produces much more accurate results; IVIA=1 (analytical integration) is to be used only for molecular calculations or for non conducting polymers. 6. Total CP’s are always obtained by summing core and valence contributions. 7. Reasonable values of the integration parameters depend on the system under investi- gation. The normalization integral of the CP’s is a good check of the accuracy of the calculation. For instance, in the case of the valence electron of beryllium (test 9), good values of RINT and IS are 10. a.u. and 4 respectively. In the case of silicon (test 10), good values of the same variables are 8. a.u. and 8 respectively. Much greater RINT values are required in order to include all the core electrons (70. a.u. in the case of silicon, and 25. a.u. in the case of beryllium). 8. BR (auto-correlation function or reciprocal space form factor) should be calculated only for valence electrons. All electron BR are reliable when the normalization integral, after the analytical integration for core electrons contribution, is equal to the number of core electrons. 9.

In unrestricted calculations (see keywords UHF or SPIN, p. 131 and 140), the spatial part of the spin-up and down orbitals may be diﬀerent ϕα i ̸= ϕβ i . This results in a larger variational freedom, typically leading to lower energy solutions, but the resulting wavefunction is no longer guaranteed to be an eigenfunction of ˆ S2, as it may be contaminated by components with higher spin multiplicity. Let us consider an open-shell system with Nα spin-up electrons and Nβ < Nα spin-down electrons. The spin-contamination ∆S of the unrestricted wavefunction is deﬁned as follows (a molecular formalism is here adopted for simplicity): ∆S = ⟨ˆ S2⟩−⟨ˆ S2⟩pure = Nβ − Nα X i=1 Nβ X j=1 ⟨φα i |φβ j ⟩⟨φβ j |φα i ⟩, (14.24) where ⟨ˆ S2⟩pure is the ideal expectation value of the ˆ S2 operator for a pure spin state: ⟨ˆ S2⟩pure = Sz(Sz + 1) with Sz = \\x12Nα −Nβ 2 \\x13 .

The electron charge density is a function that exhibits translational invariance so that we can consider its expression just in the reference cell ρcell(r). Let us introduce an, to some extent arbitrary, approximation: the partition of ρcell(r) into atomic contributions, based on some criteria: ρcell(r) = X A∈cell ρA(r −rA) where rA is the equilibrium position of atom A in the cell. Within such an approximation the expression of the static structure factors simply becomes: Fhkl = X A∈cell fA(k)eik·rA with fA(k) = Z drρA(r)eik·r A simple way for introducing the eﬀect of thermal nuclear motion in the above expression is represented by the so-called atomic Debye-Waller factors DWA(k): ˜ Fhkl = X A∈cell fA(k)eik·rA × e−DWA(k) 357'},\n"," {'page_number': 357,\n","  'page_char_count': 2513,\n","  'page_word_count': 419,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 16,\n","  'page_token_count': 628.25,\n","  'text': 'where the symbol ˜ Fhkl represents dynamic structure factors and where, if one assumes a har- monic anisotropic potential acting over the atoms and a Gaussian probability of ﬁnding an atom displaced by its equilibrium position, the Debye-Waller factors can be expressed as DWA(k) = 1 2⟨k|UA|k⟩ where UA is the mean square displacement tensor (that depends upon temperature): UA = \\uf8ee \\uf8f0 ⟨x2 1⟩ ⟨x1x2⟩ ⟨x1x3⟩ ⟨x2x1⟩ ⟨x2 2⟩ ⟨x2x3⟩ ⟨x3x1⟩ ⟨x3x2⟩ ⟨x2 3⟩ \\uf8f9 \\uf8fb with xi components of the displacement of atom A with respect to its equilibrium position.

An external electric ﬁeld can force the system to change from one structure to the other, passing through a small energy maximum. The centrosymmetric unstable structure which sits in the middle of the λ=+1 and λ=−1 structures can be labelled by the geometric parameters λ=0. The spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric materials is then evaluated through either a Berry phase approach [239, 57] or a localized Wannier functions approach, as the polarization diﬀer- ence between one of the two enantiomorphic structures (λ=+1 or λ=−1) and the intermediate geometric structure (λ=0). Three subsequent runs are required. 1. First run: preliminary calculation related to λ=0 structure 2. Second run: preliminary calculation related to λ=+1 (or λ=−1) structure 3. Third run: merging of previous data Some comments: 1. The unit-cell has to contain an even number of electrons. 2. Cell parameters have to be the same for whatever value of the geometric parameter λ. The diﬀerence between the λ=+1, λ=0, and λ=−1 structures is only in the atomic positions. 3. Numerical accuracy and computational parameters in input block 3 (such as TOLIN- TEG, POLEORDR, etc.) should be the same for the ﬁrst and the second run. 4. See page 346 for the NEWK input, which has to be the same for the ﬁrst and the second run. The shrinking factor IS should be at least equal to 4. Fermi energy calculation is not necessary, then set IFE=0. 5. Data evaluated with the keywords POLARI or LOCALI in the ﬁrst two runs do not have any physical meaning if considered independently. Only the output produced choos- ing the keywords SPOLBP or SPOLWF in the third run is signiﬁcant. 6. When the λ=−1 geometric structure is chosen in the second run, the spontaneous polar- ization vector obtained at the end will have the same modulus and direction but opposite versus with respect to the vector obtained by choosing the λ=+1 structure. 7. The spontaneous polarization is obtained through either the Berry phase approach or the localized Wannier functions approach. Since a phase is deﬁned only in the interval −π to +π, each component of the spontaneous polarization vector is deﬁned to within an integer number (positive or negative) of the correspondent component of the ”quantum of polarization” vector, which is automatically shown in the output of the third run. Usually there is not need to take into account the quantum of polarization vector, unless the ferroelectric material shows a large value of the spontaneous polarization. In case of doubt whether the quantum of polarization vector has to be considered or not, it is possible to evaluate the spontaneous polarization by setting in the second run a geometric structure corresponding to an intermediate geometric parameter, e.g. λ=0.25, and then to extrapolate linearly the result to the λ=1 structure. 361'},\n"," {'page_number': 361,\n","  'page_char_count': 1975,\n","  'page_word_count': 363,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 11,\n","  'page_token_count': 493.75,\n","  'text': 'Deck 1 Potassium niobate - KNbO3 CRYSTAL 3D system 0 0 0 IFLAG IFHR IFSO 123 space group, P4/mmm 3.997 4.063 lattice parameters 4 4 non equivalent atoms (5 atoms in the primitive cell) 19 0.5 0.5 0.5 Z=19, Potassium; x, y, z (multiplicity 1) 8 0.0 0.0 0.5 Z=8, Oxygen I; x, y, z (multiplicity 1) 8 0.5 0.0 0.0 Z=8, Oxygen II; x, y, z (multiplicity 2) 41 0.0 0.0 0.0 Z=41, Niobium; x, y, z (multiplicity 1) END end of geometry input records Deck 2 Potassium niobate - KNbO3 CRYSTAL 3D system 0 0 0 IFLAG IFHR IFSO 123 space group, P4/mmm 3.997 4.063 lattice parameters 4 4 non equivalent atoms (5 atoms in the primitive cell) 19 0.5 0.5 0.5 Z=19, Potassium; x, y, z (multiplicity 1) 8 0.0 0.0 0.5 Z=8, Oxygen I; x, y, z (multiplicity 1) 8 0.5 0.0 0.0 Z=8, Oxygen II; x, y, z (multiplicity 2) 41 0.0 0.0 0.0 Z=41, Niobium; x, y, z (multiplicity 1) FRACTION fractional coordinates ATOMDISP displacement of atoms 4 four atoms to be displaced 1 0.0 0.0 -0.023 displacement of atom no. 1 (Potassium) 2 0.0 0.0 -0.042 displacement of atom no. 2 (Oxygen II) 3 0.0 0.0 -0.042 displacement of atom no. 3 (Oxygen II) 4 0.0 0.0 -0.040 displacement of atom no. 4 (Oxygen I) END end of geometry input records SPOLBP - Spontaneous polarization (Berry phase approach) To calculate the spontaneous polarization, a preliminary with the keyword POLARI run is needed for each of the two systems λ = 1 and λ = 0.

Isotropic eﬀect (IS) The energy associated to a nuclear spin transition, ∆Eγ, is directly proportional to the total electron density ρ(r) and this means than nuclei subjected to a diﬀerent ﬁeld due to their chemical surrounding, absorb at a slightly diﬀerent frequency. Experimentally what is observed is the shift δ, expressed in terms of the Doppler velocity (mm/s) needed to achieve the resonance absorption between the source S (i.e. the nucleus which emits the γ-ray) and the absorber A (i.e. the nucleus which undergoes the spin transition): δ = c Eγ (∆EA γ −∆ES γ ) (14.29) where c is the light velocity and Eγ the energy of the γ ray. Exploiting the proportionality between ∆Eγ and ρ(r), it is possible to state that: δ = A[ρA e (0) −ρS e (0)] (14.30) where the constant A groups a certain number of terms (relativist eﬀects among the others) for a given isotope. Since all components in equation 14.30 are constant for a given isotope but the electron density of the absorber, it is suﬃcient to consider the simpliﬁed equation: δ = a[ρA e (0) −b] (14.31) with a and b to be determined in a calibration procedure in which the calculated electron density at a given nucleus is plotted versus the experimentally determined isotopic shift (IS) δ, for a series of compounds containing that nucleus. Once the a and b parameters, for a series of omogeneus compounds (i.e. organic, organo-metallic, inorganic,..) of a given nucleus, have been calculated can be used to infer the chemical shift of such nucleus in systems for which the experimental data are unknown or ambiguous[295, 286]. Anisotropic eﬀect If the nucleus possess a quadrupolar tensor, Q, the ﬁrst excited nuclear spin state splits into two double degenerated and equally probable spin states, characterized by the energies E3/2 ±EQI, where the quadrupolar interaction (QI) is of the form: EQI = −e2 1 6 X i,j=1,3 VijQij = V · Q (14.32) the Q tensor, representing the deviation of the nuclear charge from the ideal spherical shape, is almost a constant for a given nucleus and can be obtained experimentally. The 3x3 V matrix contains the electric ﬁeld gradients at the nucleus and can be diagonalize to obtain the eigenvalues VAA, VBB and VCC and the asymmetric parameter: η = VBB −VAA VCC (14.33) being always |VCC| ≥|VBB| ≥|VAA|. Experimentally a doublet is observed, corresponding to the transitions from the ground state (I = 1/2) towards the two excited states and the diﬀerence between the two peaks can be directly related to η and VCC: ∆EQI = E[3/2,QI] −E[3/2,−QI] = E3/2 + EQI −E3/2 + EQI = = 2EQI = 1 2e Q VCC(1 + η2 3 )1/2 (14.34) 364'},\n"," {'page_number': 364,\n","  'page_char_count': 1857,\n","  'page_word_count': 256,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 10,\n","  'page_token_count': 464.25,\n","  'text': 'where Q is generally expressed in barn (1 barn = 1 10−28m).

Gatti and interfaced to previous public versions of CRYSTAL[43], has presently been embedded in the code itself. By mean of the keyword TOPO, after the evaluation of the wave function, it is now possible to perform a topological analysis of the electron density, according to the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) developed by Bader and coworkers[11]. The merge of Topond into Crystal allows to exploit parallel computing. Starting from Crystal22, the Topond module has been extended to also work in terms of f- and g-type basis functions. Users of this module are kindly reminded to cite the following references: V. R. Saunders, C. Gatti and C. Roetti, J. Chem.

Erba, Molecules, 26, 4227 (2021) Topology of the Electron Density and of its Laplacian from Periodic LCAO Calculations on f-Electron Materials: The Case of Cesium Uranyl Chloride The QTAIM allows to perform a detailed study of the electron density through diﬀerent steps, ruled by various keywords the use of which is fully explained and documented in the TOPOND Manual. A brief summary is here presented. The ﬁrst step in the study of the electron density is the search of its critical points (CP) i.e. the points where its gradient, ∇ρ(r), vanishes. CPs can be classiﬁed in terms of their type and a two-way correspondence with chemically recognizable structures, namely atoms, bonds, ring and cages, can be performed providing lighting information on the bond nature[116]. A second step concerns the topological analysis of the Laplacian of the electron density, ∇2ρ(r). This analysis can reveal the atomic shell structure and the degree of sharing of paired electrons among neighboring atoms. A comparison with the corresponding properties in the case of isolated molecules, or atoms, enable to evaluate the eﬀects of the crystal packing on the bonding structure. A third step deals with the determination of the atomic basins and their local and integrated properties. Electronic population, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian kinetic energy, virial density, Becke electron localization function[21] can be deﬁned and calculated in terms of atomic contributions[117]. Finally, for sake of completeness, a certain number of quantities can be plotted and visualize in 2 and 3 dimensions: in ﬁgure 14.5 the electron density, its Laplacian and the gradient trajectories of the Urea crystal are reported. 366'},\n"," {'page_number': 366,\n","  'page_char_count': 272,\n","  'page_word_count': 45,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 4,\n","  'page_token_count': 68.0,\n","  'text': 'Figure 14.5: From left to right: electron density, ρ, its Laplacian, ∇2ρ and the ∇ρ trajectories for Urea bulk.

Pcrystal and MPPcrystal diﬀer essentially in the way they handle data in reciprocal space and for the algorithms used to diagonalize the Fock matrix and process the eigenvectors. On the other hand, data in real space, such as the calculation of one and two-electron integrals, are processed by Pcrystal and MPPcrystal through the same algorithms and parallelization strategy, and as such have the same memory requirements in the two codes; it is this section of the code that can beneﬁt from the OpenMP approach mentioned below when memory usage becomes prohibitive. Parallelism in Pcrystal, Pproperties, MPPcrystal is process based, and implemented solely through MPI. Pcrystal and Pproperties link no other libraries. MPPcrystal relies on the use of ScaLAPACK and associated libraries. The crystalOMP, PcrystalOMP and MPPcrystalOMP binaries employ OpenMP to exploit thread based parallelism. In the cases of PcrystalOMP and MPPcrystalOMP this is over and above the use of MPI mentioned in the above paragraph. The recommendation is that initial use of parallelism in a project using CRYSTAL should be with the purely MPI based binaries, but should they not prove suitable, the OMP binaries should be investigated; see the section describing the use of the OMP binaries for a description of when this might be appropriate. 368'},\n"," {'page_number': 368,\n","  'page_char_count': 3183,\n","  'page_word_count': 501,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 21,\n","  'page_token_count': 795.75,\n","  'text': '15.2 Running Pcrystal and Pproperties Pcrystal is fairly eﬃcient for small up to medium sized systems, particularly with high symmetry. Matrices in reciprocal space are distributed to processes over the irreducible representations of the group of the system. In fact, if represented in the basis of the symmetry adapted atomic orbitals (SYMADAPT, default; see page 129), such matrices are decomposed into a block-diagonal form, each block (or sub-matrix) corresponding to a row of an irreducible representation. In the case of no symmetry adaptation (NOSYMADA, page 122) or P1 symmetry, matrices are distributed over the k points of the Pack-Mokhorst net (or the k points along a selected path in Pproperties, for example, to plot energy bands). Thus, the number of processes to be employed to run Pcrystal eﬃciently should not exceed the total number of the irreducible representations for all k points in the Pack-Mokhorst net (or the number of k points when P1 or NOSYMADA), unless the diagonalization step is negligible in terms of computational time with respect to the other steps of a calculation. Double-counting must be considered for open-shell systems. Both Pcrystal and Pproperties expect to read input data from a ﬁle called INPUT in the directory which the executable is running. Output data is written to the standard error in an attempt to avoid buﬀering by any batch system. Use of option CHUNKS (page 147) is recommended to improve load balancing in DFT calculations. Option LOWMEM can be used to reduce memory requirements. As stated above parallelism in Pcrystal and Pproperties is enabled via the MPI library. Communication speed is generally not an issue in this case as inter-process communication is limited to a relatively small amount of data at few steps throughout a calculation. The limit on the available parallelism is the number of irreducible representations that can be simultaneously diagonalised, as noted above. 15.3 Running MPPcrystal 15.3.1 MPPcrystal MPPcrystal is designed to compute the total energy and wavefunction of large unit cell systems with large memory requirements, as matrices in the reciprocal space are fully distributed over the processors. [198] In particular, MPP running is recommended when nirr/nprocs (or nk/nprocs), i.e. the ratio of the number of irreducible representations at all k points (or the number of k points sampled in the reciprocal space) to the number of processors used is small. Note, unlike Pcrystal, the amount of parallelism that can be exploited is not limited by the number of irreducible representations. The advantages of MPPcrystal include: • Matrix diagonalization is well balanced because many processors are involved in the diagonalization of one matrix; • Memory requirement per processor decreases with nprocs because data are distributed to processors • I/O is limited to reading the user’s input deck and writing the output ﬁles with the results of a job. Such features make it particularly suitable to run on High Performance computers, but it can also run on smaller clusters. Since communications are more intensive than with Pcrystal, performance is improved by a fast interconnect. 369'},\n"," {'page_number': 369,\n","  'page_char_count': 3757,\n","  'page_word_count': 628,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 17,\n","  'page_token_count': 939.25,\n","  'text': 'To obtain the best performance from MPPcrystal the user should give careful consideration when choosing nprocs, the number of processes on which they intend to run the job. The reasons for this are two-fold: • MPPcrystal makes much heavier use of the interconnect than Pcrystal, and especially on slow interconnects at high process counts the calculation may become ineﬃcient due to the time to solution being dominated by the time to communicate data between the processes. • When using more than one 1 kpoint MPPcrystal is not especially intelligent about how it divides the work up amongst the available cores. As such a careful choice of the number of cores can result in signiﬁcant performance beneﬁts. As a very rough guide to the number of processes to use in order to avoid slow down due to communication the number of processes should be chosen such that ns ∗nk ∗nAO/nprocs ⪆50 where nAO is the number of atomic orbitals (basis functions) per unit cell, ns is the number of spin states, 1 for restricted calculations, 2 for unrestricted, and nk is the number of irreducible k points. Note this relationship is very much a summary of experience gained on a number of computational systems over the years and has no theoretical underpinning; if the very best performance is required the code will need to be benchmarked on the appropriate computational system. The speed of the interconnect is crucial, fast communications may allow more processes to be used, while a slow one may mean that the limit is much lower. The second consideration is to choose a number of processes that enables MPPcrystal to use dual-level parallelism. In this MPPcrystal attempts to split the set of available processes into ns ∗nk subsets, each of which will deal with a single k point at a given spin. To enable this the user should examine the set of k points and their type, and run on a number of processes given by nprocs = nr + nc ∗WEIGHT where nr and nc denote the number of k points in the Pack-Monkhorst net where the Fock matrix elements are real or complex numbers, respectively, and WEIGHT (see CMPLXFAC on page 101) accounts for the extra computational expense required diagonalize a complex matrix relative to a real one. The default value for WEIGHT is 2. Thus if using the default and a calculation has 1 real k point and 7 complex ones, for best eﬃciency the calculation should be run on a multiple of 15 processes. If this is not the case the current implementation of MPPcrystal does not take advantage of dual level parallelism, and the performance penalty can be quite severe. Note if an ineﬃcient choice is made for the number of processes a warning is printed similar to the one below ******************************************************************************* Please, consider that for this calculation a double level of parallelism can be exploited by using a number of processors given by: N_proc = 44 x a_non_prime_integer (as 4, or 6, or 8, or 9, ...)

A particular setting of convergence tool parameters, for example a given mixing rate of matrices along several SCF steps, may be eﬀective with Pcrystal and ineﬀective with MPPcrystal. However, a proper choice of the parameters will always result in achievement of the SCF cycle convergence in both cases. Like Pcrystal, MPPcrystal expects to read input data from a ﬁle called INPUT in the directory in which the executable is running. Output data is again written to standard error. MPPcrystal runs as Pcrystal if keyword REPLDATA (page 123) is added to the input deck. 15.4 Running with MPI+OpenMP parallelism in CRYS- TAL The primary purpose of adding shared memory OpenMP parallelism to MPPcrystal was to address situations where the calculation requires more memory per core than is available. In previous release of CRYSTAL this would require running with some of the cores on the node unused. The addition of OpenMP allows the unused cores to be exploited. In the simplest case if there is suﬃcient memory per core to run the calculation on all cores with MPI, then just use the MPI-only versions and ignore the OpenMP options. If each MPI process needs more memory per core than is available then the OpenMP version can be employed to exploit the unused cores and recover some of the lost performance. The number of threads is speciﬁed by including export OMP NUM THREADS=n (for sh/bash users) in the job script before the command that runs CRYSTAL, where n is the number of threads per MPI process. For example, when running 24 MPI processes on a 48 core node use OMP NUM THREADS=2. 371'},\n"," {'page_number': 371,\n","  'page_char_count': 2009,\n","  'page_word_count': 350,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 16,\n","  'page_token_count': 502.25,\n","  'text': 'Accordingly possible combinations one might use when running on 8 nodes, each with 64 cores would be • 512 MPI processes without OpenMP • 256 MPI processes, each with 2 OpenMP threads • 128 MPI processes, each with 4 OpenMP threads • 64 MPI processes, each with 8 OpenMP threads As to picking the best number of processes and threads similar observations as for Pcrystal and MPPcrystal apply, and if the very best perofrmance is required the code will need to be benchmarked. On a dual socket system one should always run an even number of MPI tasks so that each processor chip gets a equal number of those tasks, e.g. on a 48 core node 3 MPI processes with 16 threads would not be recommended. The exception to this would be when there is only 1 MPI process on each node because it needs all the memory. There are a few other situations where use of the OpenMP enabled versions of the CRYSTAL is beneﬁcial • MPPcrystal reports that increasing the bipolar buﬀer can improve performance (see 100), but runs out of memory when using the recommended value. The threaded version may provide access to the extra memory required. • When using a feature only currently available in Pcrystal, e.g. spin-orbit coupling, but the calculation requires the use of more cores. The OpenMP version of Pcrystal may be able to scale to 2 or 4 cores per k point unlike the MPI-only version which is limited to 1. • Running simple calculations on a muli-core desktop it is possible to avoid the complication of using MPI in Pcrystal. The OpenMP version of crystal may be simpler to use. The current OpenMP distribution is built using Intel’s MKL library. On non-Intel processors you will probably need to use export MKL DEBUG CPU TYPE=5 in order to get the best performance. Alternatively you can rebuild the executable from the object ﬁle package using an appropriate threaded LAPACK library for your machine. We also recommend that you set export OMP STACKSIZE=16M (or larger) when using the OpenMP version in this release. 372'},\n"," {'page_number': 372,\n","  'page_char_count': 1274,\n","  'page_word_count': 243,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 2,\n","  'page_token_count': 318.5,\n","  'text': 'Chapter 16 Input examples 16.1 Standard geometry input 3D - Crystalline compounds - 1st input record keyword: CRYSTAL Atom coordinates: fractional units of the crystallographic lattice vectors.

Final run During optimization process, the classiﬁcation of the integrals is done with reference to the input geometry, and used for all subsequent wave function calculations. In some cases, when the optimized geometry is far from the original one, the series truncation deﬁned with reference to the starting geometry may be inhomogeneous if applied to the ﬁnal geometry (see keyword FIXINDEX for explanation). In those cases, the total energy com- puted for one geometry, with integrals selected according to a diﬀerent geometry, may be not correct. A single point calculation, with the ﬁnal optimized geometry, allows to check if that is the case. 388'},\n"," {'page_number': 388,\n","  'page_char_count': 2357,\n","  'page_word_count': 485,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 12,\n","  'page_token_count': 589.25,\n","  'text': 'A safe procedure to check if that geometry corresponds to a real energy minimum, is to per- form a second optimization process, with same truncation criteria, starting from the geometry obtained in the ﬁrst optimization (read from ﬁle fort.34, keyword EXTERNAL, page 21).

It should never be forgotten that ultimately the basis functions are Bloch functions, modulated over the inﬁnite lattice: any attempt to use large uncontracted molecular or atomic basis sets, with very diﬀuse functions can result in the wasting of computational resources. The densely packed nature of many crystalline structures gives rise to a large overlap between the basis functions, and a quasi-linear dependence can occur, due to numerical limitations. The choice of the basis set (BS) is one of the critical points, due to the large variety of chemical bonding that can be found in a periodic system. For example, carbon can be involved in covalent bonds (polyacetylene, diamond) as well as in strongly ionic situations (Be2C, where the Mulliken charge of carbon is close to -4). Many basis sets for lighter elements and the ﬁrst row transition metal ions have been developed for use in periodic systems. A selection of these which have been used in published work are available on WWW: http://www.crystal.unito.it We summarize here some general considerations which can be useful in the construction of a BS for periodic systems. It is always useful to refer to some standard basis set; Pople’s STO-nG, 3-21G and 6-21G have proved to be good starting points. A molecular minimal basis set can in some cases be used as it is; larger basis sets must be re-optimized speciﬁcally for the chemical periodic structure under study. Let us explore the adequacy of the molecular BS for crystalline compounds and add some considerations which can be useful when a molecular BS must be modiﬁed or when an ex novo crystalline BS is deﬁned. 17.1 Molecular BSs performance in periodic systems Two sets of all electron basis sets are included in CRYSTAL (see Chapter 2.2): 1. Minimal STO-nG basis set of Pople and co-workers obtained by ﬁtting Slater type orbitals with n contracted GTFs (n from 2 to 6, atomic number from 1 to 54) [146, 145, 218, 217]. The above BSs are still widely used in spite of the poor quality of the resulting wave func- tion, because they are well documented and as a rule provide quite reasonable optimized geometries (due to fortuitous cancellation of errors) at low cost. 2. ”Split valence” 3-21 and 6-21 BSs. The core shells are described as a linear combination of 3 (up to atomic number 54) or 6 (up to atomic number 18) gaussians; the two valence shells contain two and one gaussians, respectively [26, 123]. Exponents (s and p functions of the same shell share the same exponent) and contraction coeﬃcients have been optimized variationally for the isolated atoms. 394'},\n"," {'page_number': 394,\n","  'page_char_count': 3155,\n","  'page_word_count': 508,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 26,\n","  'page_token_count': 788.75,\n","  'text': 'A single set of polarization functions (p,d) can be added without causing numerical problems. Standard molecular polarization functions are usually also adequate for periodic compounds. When free basis sets are chosen, two points should be taken into account: 1. From the point of view of CPU time, basis sets with sp shells (s and p functions sharing the same set of exponents) can give a saving factor as large as 4, in comparison with basis sets where s and p have diﬀerent exponents. 2. As a rule, extended atomic BSs, or ’triple zeta’ type BSs should be avoided. Many of the high quality molecular BSs (Roos, Dunning, Huzinaga) cannot be used in CRYSTAL without modiﬁcation, because the outer functions are too diﬀuse. One should not forget that the real basis functions are Bloch functions. Let us consider in more detail the possibility of using molecular BS for periodic systems. We can refer to ﬁve diﬀerent situations: Core functions Valence functions: molecular crystals covalent crystals ionic crystals metals. 17.2 Core functions In this case standard (contracted) molecular BSs can be adopted without modiﬁcation, be- cause even when very strong crystal ﬁeld eﬀects are present, the deformation of inner states is small, and can be correctly described through the linear variational parameters in SCF cal- culation. An adequate description of the core states is important in order to avoid large basis set superposition errors. 17.3 Valence functions Molecular crystals Molecular BSs, minimal and split-valence, are perfectly adequate. Tests have been performed on bulk urea [72] and oxalic acid, where the molecules are at relatively small distances, with STO-3G, 6-21, 6-21* and 6-21** BSs presenting no problem. Covalent crystals. Standard minimal and split valence BSs are usually adequate. In the split valence case the best exponent of the most diﬀuse shell is always slightly higher than the one proposed for molecules; in general it is advisable to re-optimize the exponent of this shell. This produces a slightly improved basis, while reducing the cost of the calculation. Let us consider for example the 6-21 basis set for carbon (in diamond) and silicon (bulk). At an atomic level, the best exponent of the outer shell is 0.196 and 0.093 for C and Si, respec- tively. Optimization of the valence shell has been repeated in the two crystalline compounds. The innermost valence shell is essentially unaltered with respect to the atomic solution; for the outer single-gaussian shell the best exponent is around 0.22 and 0.11 bohr−2 for carbon and silicon, as shown in Table 17.1. The last entry of Table 17.1 refers to ”catastrophic” behaviour: the low value of the exponent generates unphysical states. A set of 5 polarization single-gaussian d functions can be added to the 6-21G basis (6-21G* BS); the best exponents for the solid are very close to those resulting from the optimization in molecular contexts: 0.8 for diamond [139] and 0.45 for silicon.

Cations The classiﬁcation of covalent or ionic crystals is highly conventional, many systems being midway. Let us ﬁrst consider totally ionic compounds, such as LiH, MgO, or similar. For these systems the cation valence shell is completely empty. Therefore, for cations it is convenient to use a basis set containing the core functions plus an additional sp shell with a relatively high exponent. For example, we used for Mg in MgO and for Li in LiH ( Li2 O and Li3 N) a ’valence’ sp shell with exponent 0.4-0.3 and 0.5-0.6, respectively [79, 48]. The crystalline total energies obtained by using only core functions for Li or Mg and by adding a valence shell to the cation diﬀer by 0.1 eV/atom, or less. This ﬁgure is essentially the same for a relatively large range of exponents of the valence shell (say 0.5-0.2 for Mg) [48]. It can be diﬃcult (or impossible) to optimize the exponents of nearly empty shells: the en- ergy decreases almost linearly with the exponent. Very low exponent values can give rise to numerical instabilities, or require the calculation of an enormous number of integrals (selected on the basis of overlap criteria). In the latter cases, when the energy gain is small (∆E ≤1 m hartree for ∆α = 0.2 bohr−2), it is convenient to use a relatively large exponent. Anions Reference to isolated ion solutions is only possible for halides, because in such cases the ions are stable even at the HF level. For other anions, which are stabilized by the crystalline ﬁeld (H−, O2−, N 3−and also C4−), the basis set must be re-designed with reference to the crystalline environment. For example, let us consider the optimization of the O2−BS in Li2O [79]. Preliminary tests indicated the fully ionic nature of the compound; the point was then to allow the valence distribution to relax in the presence of the two extra electrons. We started from a standard STO-6G BS. Two more gaussians were introduced in the 1s contraction, in order to improve the virial coeﬃcient and total energy, as a check of wave function quality. The 6 valence gaussians were contracted according to a 411 scheme; the exponents of the two outer independent gaussians and the coeﬃcients of the four contracted ones were optimized. Whereas the two most diﬀuse gaussians are more diﬀuse than in the neutral isolated atom (α=0.45 and 0.15 to be compared with α=0.54 and 0.24 respectively), the rest of the O2−valence shell is unchanged with respect to the atomic situation. The introduction of d functions in the oxygen basis-set causes only a minor improvement in energy (1 10−4 hartree/cell, with a population of 0.02 electrons/atom in the cell). Ionic BSs for H and N can be found in reference 1. For anions, re-optimization of the most diﬀuse valence shell is mandatory; when starting from a standard basis set, the most diﬀuse (or the two most diﬀuse) gaussians must be allowed to relax. 396'},\n"," {'page_number': 396,\n","  'page_char_count': 3159,\n","  'page_word_count': 500,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 29,\n","  'page_token_count': 789.75,\n","  'text': 'From covalent to ionics Intermediate situations must be considered individually, and a certain number of tests must be performed in order to verify the adequacy of the selected BSs. Let us consider for example α-quartz (SiO2) and corundum (Al2O3). The exponent of the outer shell for the 2 cations in the 6-21G BS is 0.093 (Si) and 0.064 (Al), respectively; in both cases this function is too diﬀuse (in particular in the Al case it causes numerical catastrophes). For quartz, re-optimization in the bulk gives α=0.15 bohr−2 for Si (the dependence of total energy per Si atom on α is much smaller than the one resulting from Table 17.1; note too that the cost at α=0.15 is only 50% of the one at α=0.09). On the contrary, the best molecular and crystalline exponent (α=0.37) for oxygen coincide. Corundum is more ionic than quartz, and about 2 valence electrons are transferred to oxygen. In this case it is better to eliminate the most diﬀuse valence shell of Al, and to use as independent functions the two gaussians of the inner valence shells (α=0.94 and 0.20 bohr−2, respectively [244]). Metals Very diﬀuse gaussians are required to reproduce the nearly uniform density characterizing simple metallic systems, such as lithium and beryllium. This is the worse situation, where a full optimization of the atomic basis set is probably impossible. Functions which are too diﬀuse can create numerical problems, as will be discussed below. The optimization procedure can start from 6-21 BS; the most diﬀuse valence shell (exponent 0.028 for Li and 0.077 for Be) can be dropped and the innermost valence shell (exponents 0.54 and 0.10 for Li, and 1.29 and 0.268 for Be) can be split.

The resulting (reasonable) BS, derived from the split valence standard one, is reported in Table 17.2. Finally, the most diﬀuse gaussian can be optimized; in the two cases the minimum has not been found owing to numerical instabilities. See [73] for a more extensive discussion of the metallic lithium case. 17.4 Hints on crystalline basis set optimization In the deﬁnition of a valence shell BS, each exponent can be varied in a relatively narrow range: in the direction of higher exponents, large overlaps with the innermost functions may occur (the rule of thumb is: exponents must be in a ratio not too far from 3; ratios smaller than 397'},\n"," {'page_number': 397,\n","  'page_char_count': 3692,\n","  'page_word_count': 565,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 22,\n","  'page_token_count': 923.0,\n","  'text': '2 can give linear dependence problems); proceeding towards lower exponents, one must avoid large overlaps with a high number of neighbours (remember: the basis functions are Bloch functions). Diﬀuse gaussian orbitals play a critical role in HF-LCAO calculations of crystals, especially the three-dimensional ones; they are expensive, not always useful, in some cases dangerous. • Cost. The number of integrals to be calculated increases dramatically with decreasing exponents; this eﬀect is almost absent in molecular calculations. Table 17.1 shows that the cost of the calculation (number of bielectronic integrals) for silicon (diamond) can increase by a factor 10 (6) simply by changing the exponent of the most diﬀuse single-gaussian from 0.168 to 0.078 (0.296 to 0.176). The cost is largely dominated by this shell, despite the fact that large contractions are used for the 1s, 2sp and the innermost valence shell. A high number of contracted primitives tremendously increases the integrals computation time. • Usefulness. In atoms and molecules a large part of the additional variational freedom provided by diﬀuse functions is used to describe the tails of the wave function, which are poorly represented by the e−αr2 decay of the gaussian function. On the contrary, in crystalline compounds (in particular 3D non-metallic systems), low exponent functions do not contribute appreciably to the wave function, due to the large overlap between neighbours in all directions. A small split valence BS such as the 6-21G one, is nearer to the variational limit in crystals than in molecules. • Numerical accuracy and catastrophic behaviour. In some conditions, during the SCF (periodic) calculation, the system ’falls’ into non-physical states, characterized by very low single particle and total energies (see for example the last entry in Table 17.1 and the above discussion on metals). This behaviour, generically interpreted in our early papers as due to ’linear dependence’, is actually due to poor accuracy in the treatment of the Coulomb and exchange series. The exchange series is much more delicate, for two reasons: ﬁrst, long range contributions are not taken into account (whereas the long range Coulomb contributions are included, although in an approximate way); second, the ”pseudoverlap” criteria associated with the two computational parameters ITOL4 and ITOL5 mimic only in an approximate way the real behaviour of the density matrix. The risks of ”numerical catastrophes” increase rapidly with a decreasing exponent; higher precision is required in order to obtain physical solutions. For non-metallic systems, and split-valence type BSs, the default computational conditions given in section 2.3 are adequate for the optimization of the exponents of the valence shell and for systematic studies of the energy versus volume curves. For metallic systems, the optimization of the energy versus exponent curve could require ex- tremely severe conditions for the exchange series and, as a consequence, for the reciprocal space net. Reasonable values of the valence shell exponent (say 0.23 for beryllium and 0.10 for lithium, see Table 17.2), though not corresponding to a variational minimum, are reason- ably adequate for the study of the structural and electronic properties of metallic systems (see reference 1). 17.5 Check on basis-set quasi-linear-dependence In order to check the risk of linear dependence of Bloch functions, it is possible to calculate the eigenvalues of the overlap matrix in reciprocal space by running integrals and entering the keyword EIGS (input block 3, page 103).

The local functions are expressed as linear combinations of a certain number, nG, of individually normalized (basis set) Gaussian type functions (GTF) characterized by the same centre, with ﬁxed coeﬃcients, dj and exponents, αj, deﬁned in the input: ϕµ(r −Aµ −g) = nG X j dj G(αj; r −Aµ −g) (18.3) The AOs belonging to a given atom are grouped into shells, λ. The shell can contain all AOs with the same quantum numbers, n and ℓ, (for instance 3s, 2p, 3d shells), or all the AOs with the same principal quantum number, n, if the number of GTFs and the corresponding exponents are the same for all of them (mainly sp shells; this is known as the sp shells constraint). These groupings permit a reduction in the number of auxiliary functions that need to be calculated in the evaluation of electron integrals and therefore increase the speed of calculation. A single, normalized, s-type GTF, Gλ, is associated with each shell (the adjoined Gaussian of shell λ). The α exponent is the smallest of the αj exponents of the Gaussians in the contraction. The adjoined Gaussian is used to estimate the AO overlap and select the level of approximation to be adopted for the evaluation of the integrals. The expansion coeﬃcients of the Bloch functions, aµ,i(k), are calculated by solving the matrix equation for each reciprocal lattice vector, k: F(k)A(k) = S(k)A(k)E(k) (18.4) in which S(k) is the overlap matrix over the Bloch functions, E(k) is the diagonal energy matrix and F(k) is the Fock matrix in reciprocal space: F(k) = X g Fg eik·g (18.5) 400'},\n"," {'page_number': 400,\n","  'page_char_count': 2395,\n","  'page_word_count': 475,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 12,\n","  'page_token_count': 598.75,\n","  'text': 'The matrix elements of Fg, the Fock matrix in direct space, can be written as a sum of one-electron and two-electron contributions in the basis set of the AO: F g 12 = Hg 12 + Bg 12 (18.6) The one electron contribution is the sum of the kinetic and nuclear attraction terms: Hg 12 = T g 12 + Zg 12 = ⟨ϕ0 1 | b T | ϕg 2⟩+ ⟨ϕ0 1 | b Z | ϕg 2⟩ (18.7) In core pseudopotential calculations, ˆ Z includes the sum of the atomic pseudopotentials.

Where possible, terms of the Coulomb series are aggregated so as to reduce the number of integrals to be evaluated; 2. Exchange integrals which will combine with small density matrix elements are disre- garded; 3. Integrals between non-overlapping distributions are approximated; 4. Approximations for large integrals must be very accurate; for small integrals large per- centage errors can be accepted; 5. Selection must be very eﬃcient, because a large number of possible terms must be checked (adjoined Gaussians are very useful from this point of view). 401'},\n"," {'page_number': 401,\n","  'page_char_count': 3100,\n","  'page_word_count': 579,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 19,\n","  'page_token_count': 775.0,\n","  'text': '18.3 Treatment of the Coulomb series For the evaluation of the Coulomb contributions to the total energy and Fock matrix, correct coupling of electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions is essential. The computational technique for doing so was presented by Dovesi et al [78] and by Saunders et al. [250]. It may be summarized as follows. Consider the Coulomb bielectronic contribution to the Fock matrix (Cg 12) and to the total energy : Ecoul ee = 1 2 X 1,2 X g P g 12 X 3,4 X n P n 3,4 X h [(ϕ0 1ϕg 2 | ϕh 3 ϕh+n 4 ) (18.13) Seven indices are involved in equation 18.13; four of them (1, 2, 3 and 4) refer to the AOs of the unit cell; in principle, the other three (g, n and h) span the inﬁnite set of translation vectors: for example, ϕg 2(r) is AO number 2 in cell g. P is the density matrix; the usual notation is used for the bielectronic integrals. Due to the localized nature of the basis set, the total charges, q1 and q2, associated with the two pseudo-overlap distributions: {G10G2g} and {G3hG4h+n}, decay exponentially to zero with increasing |g| and |n| (for example, G1 is the adjoined gaussian of the shell to which ϕ1 belongs). A Coulomb overlap parameter, Sc, can be deﬁned in such a way that when either q1 or q2 are smaller than Sc, the bielectronic integral is disregarded, and the sum over g or n truncated. The ITOL1 input parameter is deﬁned as ITOL1=−log10Sc. The same parameter value is used for selecting overlap, kinetic, and multipole integrals. The problem of the h summation in equation 18.13 is more delicate, h being related to the distance between the two interacting distributions. The multipolar expansion scheme illus- trated below is particularly eﬀective when large unit cell or low dimensionality systems are considered. The electron-electron and electron-nuclei series (Cg 12 and Zg 12 ) can be rearranged as follows: 1. Mulliken shell net charge distributions are deﬁned as : ρλ(r −h) ≡{λ}′ ≡{λ} −Zλ = X 3∈λ X 4n P n 34 ϕ3(r −h) ϕ4(r −h −n) −Zλ (18.14) where Zλ is the fraction of nuclear charge formally attributed to shell λ, and {λ} is the electron charge distribution of shell λ. 2. Z and C contributions are reordered: Cg 12 + Zg 12 = X λ X h Z dr dr′ϕ0 1(r) ϕg 2(r) |r −r′ −h|−1 ρλ(r′ −h) (18.15) 3. For a given shell λ, there is a ﬁnite set Bλ of h vectors for which the two interacting distributions overlap; in this Bλ zone (bielectronic zone), all the bielectronic integrals are evaluated explicitly. In the outer, inﬁnite region which we deﬁne as Mλ, complementary to Bλ (the mono-electronic zone), ρλ can be expanded in multipoles and the series can be evaluated to inﬁnity analytically, using Ewald’s method combined with recursion formulae [250]. The resulting expression for the Coulomb contribution to the Fock matrix is: Cg 12 + Zg 12 = P λ{PBλ h [P 3∈λ P 4 P n P n 34(ϕ0 1ϕg 2 | ϕh 3 ϕh+n 4 ) + − P ℓ,m γm ℓ(Aλ; {λ})Φm ℓ(12g; Aλ + h)] + (18.16) + P h P ℓ,m γm ℓ(Aλ; {λ}′)Φm ℓ(12g; Aλ + h)} where: γm ℓ(Aλ; {λ}) = Z dr ρλ(r −Aλ)N m ℓXm ℓ(r −Aλ) (18.17) Φm ℓ(12g; Aλ + h) = Z drϕ0 1(r)ϕg 2(r)Xm ℓ(r −Aλ −h) |r −Aλ −h|−2ℓ−1 (18.18) 402'},\n"," {'page_number': 402,\n","  'page_char_count': 3999,\n","  'page_word_count': 694,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 24,\n","  'page_token_count': 999.75,\n","  'text': 'The Ewald term in eq. 18.16 includes zones Bλ + Mλ. The contribution from Bλ is subtracted. The Xm ℓ functions entering in the deﬁnition of the multipoles and ﬁeld terms are real, solid harmonics, and N m ℓ, the corresponding normalization coeﬃcients. The advantage of using equation 18.16 is that many four-centre (long-range) integrals can be replaced by fewer three-centre integrals. The attribution of the interaction between ρ1 = {10, 2g} and ρλ to the exact, short-range or to the approximate, long-range zone is performed by comparing the penetration between ρ1 and ρλ with the ITOL2 input parameter (if ITOL2> −log S1λ, then ρλ is attributed to the exact Bλ zone). The multipolar expansion in the approximate zone is truncated at L = ℓmax. The default value of L is 4; the maximum possible value is 6, the minimum suggested value, 2 (deﬁned via the input keyword POLEORDR, input block 3, page 122). 18.4 The exchange series The exchange series does not require particular manipulations of the kind discussed in the previous section for the Coulomb series, but needs a careful selection of the terms contributing appreciably to the Fock operator and to the total energy [47]. The exchange contribution to the total energy can be written as follows: Eex = 1 2 X 12 X g P g 12 [−1 2 X 34 X n P n 34 X h (ϕ0 1ϕh 3 | ϕg 2ϕh+n 4 )] (18.19) where the term in square brackets is the exchange contribution to the 12g element of the direct space Fock matrix. Eex has no counterpart of opposite sign as the Coulomb term has; hence, it must converge by itself. The h summation can be truncated after a few terms, since the {ϕ0 1ϕh 3 } overlap distribution decays exponentially as h increases. Similar considerations apply to the second charge distri- bution. In CRYSTAL, the h summation is, therefore, truncated when the charge associated with either {G10 G3h} or {G2g G4h + n} is smaller than 10−ITOL3. The situation is more complicated when g and n summations are analysed. Let us consider the leading terms at large distance, corresponding to ϕ1=ϕ3, ϕ2=ϕ4, h = 0 and n = g: eg 12 = −1/4(P g 12)2(10 10|2g 2g) = −(pg)2/(4|g|) (18.20) (Here pg indicates the dominant P matrix element at long range). Since the number of terms per unit distance of this kind increases as |g|d−1, where d is the dimensionality of the system, it is clear that the convergence of the series depends critically on the long range behaviour of the bond order matrix. Cancellation eﬀects, associated in particular with the oscillatory behaviour of the density ma- trix in metallic systems, are not predominant at long range. Even if the actual behaviour of the P matrix elements cannot be predicted because it depends in a complicated way on the physical nature of the compound [222], on orthogonality constraints and on basis set quality, the diﬀerent range of valence and core elements can be exploited by adopting a pseudoverlap criterion. This consists in truncating g summations when the R drϕ0 1ϕg 2 overlap is smaller than a given threshold, deﬁned as P g ex (where ITOL4 = -log10 (P g ex)) and also truncating the n summation when R drϕ0 3ϕn 4 overlap is smaller than the threshold, P n ex (ITOL5 = -log10 (P n ex)). Despite its partially arbitrary nature, this criterion presents some advantages with respect to other more elaborate schemes: it is similar to the other truncation schemes (ITOL1, ITOL2, ITOL3), and so the same classiﬁcation tables can be used; it is, in addition, reasonably eﬃcient in terms of space occupation and computer time. This truncation scheme is symmetric with respect to the g and n summations. However, if account is not taken of the diﬀerent role of the two summations in the SC (Self Consistent) stage, distortions may be generated in the exchange ﬁeld as felt by charge distributions ϕ1ϕT 2 , where T labels the largest (in modulus) g vector taken into account according to ITOL4. This distortion may be variationally exploited, and unphysically large density matrix elements build 403'},\n"," {'page_number': 403,\n","  'page_char_count': 3907,\n","  'page_word_count': 652,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 22,\n","  'page_token_count': 976.75,\n","  'text': 'up progressively along the SC stage, eventually leading to catastrophic behaviour (see Chapter II.5 of reference [224] for a discussion of this point). In order to overcome this problem, the threshold, P n ex (ITOL5) for n summation must be more severe than that for g summation (ITOL4). In this way, all the integrals whose second pseudo charge R drϕ0 3ϕn 4 is larger than P n ex are taken into account. A diﬀerence in the two thresholds ranging from three to eight orders of magnitude is suﬃcient to stabilize the SC behaviour in most cases. 18.5 Bipolar expansion approximation of Coulomb and exchange integrals We may now return to the partition of the h summation in the Coulomb series shown in equation 18.13. Consider one contribution to the charge distribution of electron 1, centred in the reference cell: ρ0 = ϕ0 1ϕg 2; now consider the charge distribution ρλ(h) of shell λ centred in cell h (equation 18.14). For small |h| values, ρλ and ρ0 overlap, so that all the related bielectronic integrals must be evaluated exactly, one by one; for larger values of |h|, ρλ is external to ρ0, so that all the related bielectronic integrals are grouped and evaluated in an approximate way through the multipolar expansion of ρλ . However, in many instances, although ρλ is not external to ρ0, the two-centre ϕh 3 ϕh+n 4 con- tributions to ρλ are external to ρ0 = ϕ0 1ϕg 2; in this case, instead of exactly evaluating the bielectronic integral, a two-centre truncated bipolar expansion can be used (see Chapter II.4.c in reference [224] and references therein). In order to decide to which zone a shell may be ascribed, we proceed as follows: when, for a given pair of shells λ0 1λg 2, shell λh 3 is attributed to the B (bielectronic) zone, the penetration between the products of adjoined Gaussians G0 1Gg 2 and Gh 3 Gh+n 4 is estimated: the default value of the penetration parameter is 14, and the block of bielectronic integrals is attributed accordingly to the be (exact) or to the bb (bipolar) zone. The set of h vectors deﬁning the B zone of ρ0= {12g} and ρλ ≡{λ3} is then split into two subsets, which are speciﬁc for each partner λl 4 of λ3. A similar scheme is adopted for the selected exchange integrals (see previous section) whose pseudo charges do not overlap appreciably. The default value of the penetration parameter is 10. The total energy change due to the bipolar expansion approximation should not be greater than 10−4 hartree/atom; exact evaluation of all the bielectronic integrals (obtained by setting the penetration parameter value > 20000) increases the computational cost by a factor of between 1.3 and 3. Multipolar expansion is very eﬃcient, because the following two conditions are fulﬁlled: 1. A general algorithm is available for reaching high ℓvalues easily and economically [78, 250]. The maximum allowed value is ℓ=6. 2. The multipolar series converges rapidly, either because the interacting distributions are nearly spherical (shell expansion), or because their functional expression is such that their multipoles are zero above a certain (low) ℓvalue. 18.6 Exploitation of symmetry Translational symmetry allows the factorization of the eigenvalue problem in periodic calcula- tions, because the Bloch functions are a basis for irreducible representations of the translational group. In periodic calculations, point symmetry is exploited to reduce the number of points for which the matrix equations are to be solved. Point symmetry is also explicitly used in the reconstruc- tion of the Hamiltonian, which is totally symmetric with respect to the point group operators of the system. In the HF-CO-LCAO scheme, the very extensive use of point symmetry allows us to evaluate bielectronic and mono-electronic integrals with saving factors as large as h in the number of bielectronic integrals to be computed or h2 in the number of those to be stored for the SCF part 404'},\n"," {'page_number': 404,\n","  'page_char_count': 2843,\n","  'page_word_count': 489,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 32,\n","  'page_token_count': 710.75,\n","  'text': 'of the calculation, where h is the order of the point group. The main steps of the procedure [71] can be summarized as follows: • The set of Coulomb and exchange integrals whose 3,4 indices identify translationally equivalent pairs of AOs, so that the associated element of the density matrix P34 is the same, are summed together to give D1234 elements: D1,2T ;3,4Q = X n [(ϕ0 1ϕg 2 | ϕh 3 ϕh+n 4 ) −1/2(ϕ0 1ϕh 3 | ϕg 2ϕh+n 4 )] (18.21) • The products of AOs ϕ1ϕ2 ( and ϕ3ϕ4) are classiﬁed in symmetry-related sets; using the fact that the Fock matrix is totally symmetric, only those quantities are evaluated whose indices 1, 2 refer to the ﬁrst member of a symmetry set. The corresponding saving factor is as large as h. • Using the symmetry properties of the density matrix, D quantities referring to 3, 4, cou- ples belonging to the same symmetry set (and with the same 1, 2g index) can be combined after multiplication by appropriate symmetry matrices, so that a single quantity for each 3, 4 symmetry set is to be stored, with a saving factor in storage of the order of h. • The symmetry Pn 34 = P−n 43 is exploited. • The symmetry Fg 12 = F−g 21 is exploited. Symmetry-adapted Crystalline Orbitals A computational procedure for generating space-symmetry-adapted Bloch functions, when BF are built from a basis of local functions (AO), is implemented in the CRYSTAL98 code. The method, that applies to any space group and AOs of any quantum number, is based on the diagonalization of Dirac characters. For its implementation, it does not require character tables or related data as an input, since the information is automatically generated starting from the space group symbol and the AO basis set.

The problem arises at each stage of the self-consistent procedure, when determining the Fermi energy, ϵF , when reconstructing the one-electron density matrix, and, after self- consistency is reached, when calculating the density of states (DOS) and a number of observable quantities. The P matrix in direct space is computed following equation 18.9. The technique adopted to compute ϵF and the P matrix in the SCF step is described in reference [100]. The Fourier-Legendre technique presented in Chapter II.6 of reference [224] is adopted in the calculation of total and projected DOS. The Fermi energy and the integral in equation 18.9 are evaluated starting from the knowledge of the eigenvalues, ϵn(k) and the eigenvectors, aµn(k), at a certain set of sampling points, {κ}. In 3D crystals, the sampling points belong to a lattice (called the Monkhorst net, [191] ) with basis vectors b1/s1, b2/s2, b3/s3, where b1, b2 and b3 are the ordinary reciprocal lattice vectors; s1, s2 and s3 (input as IS1, IS2 and IS3) are integer shrinking factors. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, IS1=IS2=IS3=IS. In 2D crystals, IS3 is set equal to 1; in 1D crystals both IS2 and IS3 are set equal to 1. Only points of the Monkhorst net belonging to the irreducible part of the Brillouin Zone (BZ) are considered, with associated geometrical weights, wi. In the selection of the κ points for non-centrosymmetric crystal, time-reversal symmetry is exploited (ϵn(κ) = ϵn(−κ)). The number of inequivalent sampling points, κi, is asymptotically given by the product of the shrinking factors divided by the order of the point group. In high symmetry systems and with small si values, it may be considerably larger because many points lie on symmetry planes or axes. Two completely diﬀerent situations (which are automatically identiﬁed by the code) must now be considered, depending on whether the system is an insulator (or zero gap semiconductor), or a conductor. In the former case, all bands are either fully occupied or vacant. The identiﬁcation of ϵF is elementary, and the Fourier transform expressed by equation 18.9 is reduced to a weighted sum of the integrand function over the set {κi} with weights wi, the sum over n being limited to occupied bands. The case of conductors is more complicated; an additional parameter, ISP, enter into play. ISP (or ISP1, ISP2, ISP3) are Gilat shrinking factors which deﬁne a net Gilat net [120, 119] completely analogous to the Monkhorst net. The value of ISP is larger than IS (by up to a factor of 2), giving a denser net. In high symmetry systems, it is convenient to assign IS magic values such that all low multi- plicity (high symmetry) points belong to the Monkhorst lattice. Although this choice does not correspond to maximum eﬃciency, it gives a safer estimate of the integral. The value assigned to ISP is irrelevant for non-conductors. However, a non-conductor may give rise to a conducting structure at the initial stages of the SCF cycle, owing, for instance, to a very unbalanced initial guess of the density matrix. The ISP parameter must therefore be deﬁned in all cases. 18.8 Electron momentum density and related quantities Three functions may be computed which have the same information content but diﬀerent use in the discussion of theoretical and experimental results; the momentum density itself, π(p) or EMD; the Compton proﬁle function, J(p) or CP; the autocorrelation function, or reciprocal space form factor, or internally-folded density, B(r) or BR. With reference to a Crystalline-Orbital (CO)-LCAO wave function, the EMD can be expressed as the sum of the squared moduli of the occupied COs in a momentum representation, or equivalently, as the diagonal element of the six-dimensional Fourier transform of the one- electron density matrix from conﬁguration to momentum space: 406'},\n"," {'page_number': 406,\n","  'page_char_count': 3184,\n","  'page_word_count': 531,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 15,\n","  'page_token_count': 796.0,\n","  'text': 'π(p) = occ X n X µν eip·(sµ−sν)Cµn(p0)C∗ νn(p0) χµ(p)χ∗ ν(p) θ(ϵF −ϵn(p0)) (18.22) π(p) = X µν X g P g µν eip(Sµ−g−sν) χµ(p)χ∗ ν(p) (18.23) In the above equations p0 is the value of momentum in the Brillouin zone (BZ), which is related to p by a reciprocal lattice vector K, sµ is the fractional coordinate of the χµ centre, and χµ(p) is the Fourier transform of χµ(r), calculated analytically: χµ(p) = Z dr χµ(r) e−ıp·r (18.24) The two expressions (18.22) and (18.23) are implemented in Crystal and can be used via the EMDL (EMDP) and EMDLDM (EMDPDM) keywords, respectively for EMD along a line (in a plane).

At variance with the electron charge density ρ(r), it is generally diﬃcult to fully exploit the information content of the EMD π(p) due to its “collapsed” character about the origin p = 0 in momentum space. A relatively simple way of extracting information from the total EMD of a system, is analyzing its anisotropy ∆π(p) with respect to its Spherical Average (SA) function πSA(p) which is, of course, a “radial” function of a single variable: ∆π(p) = π(p) −πSA(p) where p = |p| (18.25) The average value πSA(p) of the function π(p) over the surface of a sphere with radius p, can be computed as the average of the function values at the 60 points pn (with n = 1, . . . , 60) lying on that surface which form an orbit under the icosahedral group. It is possible to exploit the smoothed character of the spherically averaged EMD πSA(p) by explicitly evaluating it on a coarse set of values of p and then by interpolating them (we use a cubic spline). Spherically averaged EMD and EMD-anisotropies can be evaluated via the EMDLDM and EMDPDM keywords. A directional Compton proﬁle Jhkl(p) is related to a particular crystallographic directions [hkl], identiﬁed by the unit vector ehkl where hkl are the Miller indices. The directional CP Jhkl(p) contains information about the distribution of the electron’s momenta along the [hkl] direction of the crystal and can be deﬁned as the 2D integration of π(p) over a plane perpendicular to ehkl through pehkl: Jhkl(p) = Z π(p)δ(p · ehkl −p)dp (18.26) The weighted average of the directional CPs over all directions is the average CP. Both di- rectional and average CPs can be computed following the expression (18.26) via the PROF keyword. The one-dimensional Fourier transform of a directional CP, gives the so-called directional auto- correlation function Bhkl(r): Bhkl(r) = Z Jhkl(p) e−ıp rdp (18.27) Jhkl(p) = 1 2π Z Bhkl(r) eıp rdr (18.28) Directional CPs can be computed from the corresponding directional auto-correlation function via the keyword BIDIERD. Within the sudden-impulse approximation, Jhkl(p) is directly comparable to the outcome of Compton scattering experiments, after correcting the latter for limited resolution and mul- tiple scattering eﬀects. In particular, the eﬀect of limited resolution can be expressed as a convolution of the “inﬁnite resolution” data with a normalized Gaussian function g(p; σcp) 407'},\n"," {'page_number': 407,\n","  'page_char_count': 2334,\n","  'page_word_count': 419,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 6,\n","  'page_token_count': 583.5,\n","  'text': 'characterized by a given standard deviation σcp (or, equivalently, by the fwhm parameter wcp = σcp · 2√2log2) which quantiﬁes the experimental resolution: Jσ hkl(p) = Z +∞ −∞ Jhkl(p′) g(p −p′; σcp) dp′ = = 1 2π Z +∞ −∞ Bσ hkl(r) e−ı p r dr (18.29) In the last integrand a “ﬁnite resolution AF” appears, which is simply the product of the AF from equation (18.27) by a Gaussian function g(r, σbr), with σbr = 1/σcp, and can be extracted from the experimental CP simply by Fourier back-transformation. The expectation value of the kinetic energy operator ˆ T (i.e the kinetic energy of the system Ekin) can be expressed in terms of the second moment of the electron momentum distribution π(p) as follows: Ekin = ⟨ˆ T⟩= 1 2 Z π(p)p2dp virial = −E0 (18.30) where the last passage recalls that, if the virial theorem is satisﬁed, the kinetic energy equals (apart from the sign that is opposite) the total energy of the system. Let us introduce the kinetic tensor T whose elements Tuv can be deﬁned as: Tuv = 1 2 Z π(p)pu pvdp with u, v = x, y, z (18.31) The kinetic energy of the system is then the trace of the kinetic tensor: Ekin = ⟨ˆ T⟩= Tr(T) (18.32) The kinetic tensor can be computed via the KINETEMD keyword of Properties. A possible strategy for partitioning the electron momentum density (EMD) of a periodic system into chemically meaningful contributions is that of exploiting the spatially localized character of Wannier functions (WF). Let us introduce the so-called Wannier functions that are real-valued, well localized functions of r, which span altogether the same space as the occupied COs and are translationally equivalent and mutually orthonormal: Wi,0(r) = Wi,g(r + g) ; (18.33) R Wi,g(r) Wi′,g′(r) dr = δii′δgg′ (18.34) Such functions are in turn expressed as LCAO: Wi,g(r) = X µ X g′ wi,g;µg′ χµ(r −sµ −g′) (18.35) The WFs can be obtained from the set of occupied COs via a unitary transformation that imposes spatial localization. Let us express the EMD in terms of WFs: π(p) = 2 L N0/2 X i=1 L X g Wi,g(p) Wi,g(p)∗ (18.36) = 2 N0/2 X i=1 Wi,0(p) Wi,0(p)∗ (18.37) = N0/2 X i=1 πi(p) with πi(p) = 2 Wi,0(p) Wi,0(p)∗ (18.38) where N0 is the number of electrons per cell, L the number of cells in the cyclic cluster; in the second passage we have exploited the translational equivalence of the WFs and in the last 408'},\n"," {'page_number': 408,\n","  'page_char_count': 2363,\n","  'page_word_count': 401,\n","  'page_sentence_count_raw': 12,\n","  'page_token_count': 590.75,\n","  'text': 'passage we make explicit the partition of the total EMD in contributions πi(p) coming from the diﬀerent WFs.

Both EMD and EMD-anisotropies from selected WFs can be computed via the EMDWF sub-keyword of LOCALWF that activates the localization of crystalline orbitals into WFs. Given the contribution πi(p) of WF i to the EMD of the system, a kinetic tensor Ti can be introduced whose elements T i uv can be deﬁned as: T i uv = 1 2 Z πi(p)pu pvdp with u, v = x, y, z (18.45) The computation of such a tensor can be activated via the EMDWFKIN sub-keyword of LOCALWF. 18.9 Elastic Moduli of Periodic Systems The elastic constants are second derivatives of the energy density with respect to strain com- ponents: Cij = 1/V · ∂2E ∂ϵi∂ϵj (18.46) where V is the volume of the cell. The energy derivatives must be evaluated numerically. Particular care is required in the selection of the computational parameters and of the points where the energy is evaluated, in order to avoid large numerical errors in the ﬁtting procedure (FIXINDEX, page 109; OPTGEOM, page 187). See http://www.crystal.unito.it ⇒tutorials ⇒Elastic and piezoelectric tensors When the unit cell is deformed, the point group is reduced to a subgroup of the original point group (see examples below). The new point group is automatically selected by the code. Oﬀ-diagonal (partial derivatives) elastic constants can be computed as linear combinations of single-variable energy curves. For example, for a cubic system, C12 can be obtained from B=(C11 + 2C12)/3 and (C11 −C12) (see examples below).

However, a non-symmetric deformation will lower the symmetry of the system, and therefore increase the complexity of the calculation, since the cost required is roughly inversely proportional to the order of the point group.

From an operational point of view, it is important to carefully optimize the structure and to use accurate computational parameters. Some tools are also available to enhance the numerical quality of the Hessian matrix. Sometimes translational and rotational eigensolutions can mix with low frequency modes. In such cases, it is important to project translations and rotations out of the Hessian. This is equivalent to imposing Eckart’s conditions to the nuclear motion problem (applied by default; the NOECKART option of the FREQCALC block switches this option oﬀ). We have to generate a projection matrix P so that translations and rotations (for molecules and polymers) are separated out. Being Na the number of atoms of the system (in the unit cell for periodic systems), there are 3Na −Ne internal degrees of freedom, where Nc is the number of conditions we have to impose, which is 3 for 3D systems, 6 for non-linear molecules, 5 for linear molecules and 1 for polymers. We deﬁne a D matrix of dimensions Nc × 3Na, which is the row representation of translations and rotations in the Cartesian frame. The ﬁrst three vectors (rows) of D correspond to the three Cartesian translations along x, y and z and are just the list of the square root of the isotopic mass of the atoms times the corresponding Cartesian unit vector (ˆ x, ˆ y and ˆ z, for the ﬁrst, second and third rows, respectively). For example, in the case of water, assuming mH = 1 and mO = 16, we would have D1 = (1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0) D2 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0) (18.76) D3 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1) In order to build a representation for the rotational degrees of freedom, we have ﬁrst to translate the system so that the origin corresponds to the center of mass (CoM), whose position is given by: rCoM = PNa α=1 mαrα PNa α=1 mα (18.77) Then, we build the inertia axes tensor: I = \\uf8eb \\uf8ed Ixx Ixy Ixz Iyx Iyy Iyz Izx Izy Izz \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8= \\uf8eb \\uf8ed P α mα \\x00y2 α + z2 α \\x01 −P α mαxαyα −P α mαxαzα −P α mαyαxα P α mα \\x00x2 α + z2 α \\x01 −P α mαyαzα −P α mαzαxα −P α mαzαyα P α mα \\x00x2 α + y2 α \\x01 \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 (18.78) Matrix I is diagonalized to obtain the eigenvector matrix X (eigenvectors are organized in columns).

A point called x in the direct lattice has xP coordinates in a primitive cell and xC coordinates in a conventional cell. The relation between xP and xC is the following: WxP = xC (A.1) Likewise, for a point in the reciprocal space the following equation holds: ˜ W −1x∗ P = x∗ C (A.2) The W transforming matrices adopted in CRYSTAL, and reported below, satisfy the following relation between the two metric tensors GP and GC: GP = WGC ˜ W (A.3) The values of the elements of the metric tensors GP and GC agree with those displayed in Table 5.1 of the International Tables of Crystallography (1992 edition).

(E.75) Note that, while the AO is normalized, the function γ′′ = n γ is not; in fact n is not a normalization factor, and it will be referred as the pre-Gaussian factor. At the moment the CRYSTAL code is able to treat four type of shells: s, sp, p and d.3 An s shell has only an AO, that is a contraction of simple Gaussians (ℓ= 0); in a p one there are three AOs (diﬀerent for the m value, px, py and pz) with ℓ= 1 primitives; d shells are obviously formed by ﬁve ℓ= 2 AOs. The three basis functions of a sp shell are contractions of one s primitive function and several ps’. In the calculation of the integrals required in the SCF process, n must be very often multiplied by the constant factor π5/8 21/4; [224] therefore, in the code, pre-Gaussian factors are not stored, but the following quantities, that we shall call code pre-Gaussian constants: Sλ i = π5/8 21/4 n00 λ,i (E.76) Pλ i = π5/8 21/4 n1m λ,i ∀m = 0, 1, −1 (E.77) Dλ i = π5/8 21/4 s (2 + |m|)!

E.44) makes D independent from the m value, whereas n2m λ,i depends from it. In such a way, S, P and D are m-independent In the inpbas routine, contraction coeﬃcients (as deﬁned in input), dλ i , related to s, p and d AOs, are loaded in the two dimension packed arrays c1, c2 and c3, respectively (they are stored in the module basato module). Their length corresponds to the total number of primitives in the unit cell and is the same for the three arrays. The ﬁrst elements are the contraction coeﬃcients for the ﬁrst shell (d1 i ), then the d2 i s (second shell) follows, and so on; the contraction index, i, is the internal one. For an s shell, for example, the elements of c2 and c3 are null, of course. In the gaunov routine, c1, c2 and c3 are redeﬁned and loaded with the code pre-Gaussian constants S, P and D, respectively; naturally they maintain the described organization and module basato module is overwritten. In gaunov two further arrays, c2w and c3w (that follow the convention used in the ATMOL program) are also deﬁned and loaded in basato module. They have the same organization as c1, c2 and c3 and contain P′λ i and D′λ i coeﬃcients, respectively: P′λ i = π5/8 21/4 2αi n1m λ,i ∀m = 0, 1, −1 (E.79) D′λ i = π5/8 21/4 (2αi)2 s (2 + |m|)!

The ﬁrst strategy for the truncation of the VCI expansion consists in including only those vibrational conﬁgurations where there are a maximum of Nquanta excitation quanta involved.

A second strategy that we use to truncate the VCI expansion consists in setting a maxi- mum number of modes Nmodes that can be simultaneously excited in a given conﬁgura- tion.

The eﬀect of these two schemes on the truncation of the VCI expansion is documented in the references above. As regards Nmodes, let us note that, when working in terms of 2M4T or 3M4T representations of the PES, the VCI description converges for Nmodes = 3 and Nmodes = 4, respectively. In Crystal, after the calculation of the anharmonic terms of the PES, a VCI calculation can be activated by use of the VCI keyword. By activating a VCI calculation, a VSCF calculation will be automatically performed before it.

In the input above, the convergence threshold is set to 1·10−5 cm−1 and the mixing fraction to 40%. VCI: Theoretical Remarks and Options In the VCI method, the wave-function of each vibrational state s is written as a linear combi- nation of M-mode wave-functions of diﬀerent vibrational conﬁgurations in the form of Hartree products of modals as in Eq. (8.43): Ψs(Q) = Nconf X n=1 An,sΦn(Q) , (8.45) where the sum runs over Nconf conﬁgurations, each characterized by a vibrational conﬁguration vector n. The selection of the Nconf conﬁgurations determines the truncation of the VCI expansion. For each vibrational state s, the corresponding VCI wave-function and energy are obtained by solving the corresponding Schr¨ odinger equation HΨs = EsΨs. The VCI method can be expressed in matrix form as follows: HA = AE, where A is the squared matrix containing, column-wise, the coeﬃcients An,s of the eigenvectors, E is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and H is the VCI Hamiltonian matrix (of size Nconf × Nconf), whose elements are: Hm,n = ⟨Φm|H|Φn⟩. (8.46) The VCI method therefore reduces to the construction and diagonalization of the VCI Hamilto- nian matrix, from which all vibrational states are simultaneously determined. VSCF solutions can be used to express the modals in the VCI method (according to the so-called VCI@VSCF approach). The VCI method relies on the expansion of the wave-function of each vibrational state in terms of Nconf Hartree product functions describing diﬀerent vibrational conﬁgurations, as introduced in Eq. (8.45). The number Nconf of functions used in the VCI expansion is of critical importance with regard to both the accuracy and computational cost of the method. Indeed, the larger Nconf the better the description of the vibrational state but also the larger the size of the VCI Hamiltonian matrix in Eq.

Note that even without insertion of the VSCF keyword, a VSCF calculation will be performed anyway before the VCI one. In this way, the VSCF solutions can be used as an initial guess of the VCI treatment. As mentioned above, the VCI keyword requires the setting of three mandatory parameters: the ﬁrst parameter in the ﬁrst row below the keyword sets Nquanta (6 in the example above), the second parameter in the ﬁrst row below the keyword sets Nmodes (3 in the example above), the only parameter in the second row below the keyword can be either 0 or 1 and governs the initial guess for the VCI treatment (0 implies a harmonic initial guess, 1 implies a VSCF initial guess).

The ﬁrst strategy for the truncation of the VCI expansion consists in including only those vibrational conﬁgurations where there are a maximum of Nquanta excitation quanta involved. Formally, we can express this strategy as follows to say that only those conﬁg- urations satisfying the next condition are included in the expansion: M X i=1 ni ≤Nquanta ; (8.47) 2. A second strategy that we use to truncate the VCI expansion consists in setting a maxi- mum number of modes Nmodes that can be simultaneously excited in a given conﬁgura- tion. In other words, only those vibrational conﬁgurations where there are a maximum of Nmodes with ni ̸= 0 are used. The eﬀect of these two schemes on the truncation of the VCI expansion is documented in the references above. As regards Nmodes, let us note that, when working in terms of 2M4T or 3M4T representations of the PES, the VCI description converges for Nmodes = 3 and Nmodes = 4, respectively. In Crystal, after the calculation of the anharmonic terms of the PES, a VCI calculation can be activated by use of the VCI keyword. By activating a VCI calculation, a VSCF calculation will be automatically performed before it. The VCI keyword requires the setting of three mandatory parameters.',\n","  'chunk_char_count': 1237,\n","  'chunk_word_count': 210,\n","  'chunk_token_count': 309.25,\n","  'embedding':

In the input above, the convergence threshold is set to 1·10−5 cm−1 and the mixing fraction to 40%. VCI: Theoretical Remarks and Options In the VCI method, the wave-function of each vibrational state s is written as a linear combi- nation of M-mode wave-functions of diﬀerent vibrational conﬁgurations in the form of Hartree products of modals as in Eq. (8.43): Ψs(Q) = Nconf X n=1 An,sΦn(Q) , (8.45) where the sum runs over Nconf conﬁgurations, each characterized by a vibrational conﬁguration vector n. The selection of the Nconf conﬁgurations determines the truncation of the VCI expansion. For each vibrational state s, the corresponding VCI wave-function and energy are obtained by solving the corresponding Schr¨ odinger equation HΨs = EsΨs. The VCI method can be expressed in matrix form as follows: HA = AE, where A is the squared matrix containing, column-wise, the coeﬃcients An,s of the eigenvectors, E is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and H is the VCI Hamiltonian matrix (of size Nconf × Nconf), whose elements are: Hm,n = ⟨Φm|H|Φn⟩. (8.46) The VCI method therefore reduces to the construction and diagonalization of the VCI Hamilto- nian matrix, from which all vibrational states are simultaneously determined. VSCF solutions can be used to express the modals in the VCI method (according to the so-called VCI@VSCF approach). The VCI method relies on the expansion of the wave-function of each vibrational state in terms of Nconf Hartree product functions describing diﬀerent vibrational conﬁgurations, as introduced in Eq. (8.45). The number Nconf of functions used in the VCI expansion is of critical importance with regard to both the accuracy and computational cost of the method. Indeed, the larger Nconf the better the description of the vibrational state but also the larger the size of the VCI Hamiltonian matrix in Eq.
