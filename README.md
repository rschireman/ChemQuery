## RAG demo running gemma-7b-it completely locally on an RTX 3070 (or any gpu with at least 8 Gb VRAM)

This notebook demonstrates how to run the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using the Gemma-7B-IT model entirely on a local machine equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU. Specifically, we will ask Gemma about the CRYSTAL23 manual (https://www.crystal.unito.it/).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Here are some ways RAG can help with specific data:

1. Enhanced Information Retrieval
RAG can efficiently retrieve relevant information from a large dataset or knowledge base. By incorporating a retrieval mechanism, it ensures that the generated responses are grounded in factual data, improving the accuracy and relevance of the information provided.

Example: In a medical application, RAG can retrieve the most relevant medical literature and generate detailed explanations or summaries based on the retrieved documents, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

2. Contextual Understanding
RAG excels in understanding and maintaining context over long conversations or documents. By retrieving relevant contextual information, it ensures that the generated content is coherent and contextually appropriate.

Example: In customer support, RAG can retrieve past interactions with a customer and generate responses that take into account the entire conversation history, leading to more personalized and effective support.

3. Domain-Specific Knowledge
RAG can be fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to provide expertise in specialized fields. By leveraging a retrieval component, it can access and utilize a vast amount of domain-specific knowledge, ensuring that the generated content is both accurate and relevant to the field.

Example: In legal applications, RAG can retrieve and reference relevant legal documents, case laws, and statutes, enabling lawyers to generate precise legal arguments and documents.

4. Improved Question Answering
RAG enhances the performance of question-answering systems by retrieving relevant documents or passages that contain the answer to a query. This results in more accurate and detailed answers compared to generation-only models.

Example: In educational platforms, RAG can help students by retrieving relevant textbook sections or academic papers and generating comprehensive answers to their questions.
